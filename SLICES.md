## Phase Z — Setup

### Z1 — Push parent branch
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Push feat/super-admin-cross-tenant-view (38 unpushed commits) to origin.
- **Closes bug:** N/A (infra)
- **Files:** None (git only)
- **Discovery:** `git status`, `git log origin/...HEAD --oneline`
- **Success criteria:** origin tip matches local HEAD; backup tag pushed.
- **Requires approval:** YES (granted by Nathan 2026-04-28).
- **Outcome:** Pushed `backup/super-admin-pre-rebase-2026-04-27` first, then force-with-lease pushed `feat/super-admin-cross-tenant-view` (overrode 3 stale pre-rebase commits with 38 rebased + new commits). Origin tip = local HEAD `b264a45`.

### Z2 — Create overhaul branch
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Branch feat/bms-overhaul-2026-q2 from feat/super-admin-cross-tenant-view.
- **Files:** None (git only)
- **Success criteria:** Branch exists on origin, tracking set up.
- **Depends on:** Z1
- **Requires approval:** No.
- **Outcome:** Branch created and pushed with `-u`. Tracking origin/feat/bms-overhaul-2026-q2.

### Z3 — Vitest scaffolding
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Add Vitest + 5 smoke tests + `npm run check` script.
- **Files:** `vitest.config.ts` (new), `tests/setup.ts` (new), `tests/smoke/critical-paths.test.ts` (new), `package.json` (script additions only).
- **Success criteria:** `npm run test` passes locally.
- **Depends on:** Z2
- **Requires approval:** No.
- **Outcome:** 6 smoke tests passing in 210ms. Tests cover the pure-logic core of each named surface (RBAC matrix, status-label maps, processing-fee math) — page-render fallback declined because mocking Prisma+Supabase+cookies for happy-dom is more brittle than what it catches; bootstrap explicitly tolerated this. Vitest scoped to `tests/**` via `include[]` so the pre-existing `src/lib/**/*.test.ts` ad-hoc test files don't confuse discovery.
- **Known baseline issue:** `npm run check` fails on lint baseline (~4530 pre-existing errors). Documented in commit message and CLAUDE.md. Until Phase 3 cleanup, agents run `npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build` as the practical green-bar gate; lint only the changed files.

### Z4 — Agent constitution in CLAUDE.md
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Append "Agent operating principles" section to CLAUDE.md.
- **Files:** `CLAUDE.md` (append only — do not modify existing content).
- **Success criteria:** Section renders cleanly; commits without conflicts.
- **Depends on:** Z2
- **Requires approval:** No.
- **Outcome:** 88-line append. Includes the baseline carve-out clarifying that "never skip `npm run check`" means "don't *increase* the baseline error count" until Phase 3 turns lint/strict back on.

### Z5 — SLICES.md committed
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** This file. Commit it. Move audit + bootstrap into `docs/handoff/`. Open the Phase Z PR.
- **Files:** `SLICES.md` (this file); `docs/handoff/bms-audit-2026-04-28.md` (moved); `docs/handoff/bms-overhaul-bootstrap.md` (moved).
- **Success criteria:** PR open, all Z slices marked `awaiting_review`.
- **Depends on:** Z1–Z4
- **Requires approval:** No (this slice opens the approval gate).

**[PHASE Z APPROVAL GATE — STOP HERE]**

## Phase 0 — Data + override consistency (Week 1)

### 0a — Single deal data model
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` (discovery committed; canonical-store decision pending)
- **Goal:** Decide canonical store for "deals." Recommend: `DealSubmission` for inbound, `Transaction` for closed. Deprecate CRM `Deal` for BMS use cases.
- **Closes bug:** B-002, B-004 (root cause)
- **Files:** prisma/schema.prisma (read-only at first), lib/bms-types.ts, src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/dashboard/page.tsx, plus any server actions querying deals
- **Discovery:** Mapped every BMS surface to its DB query. Documented in `docs/bms-data-sources.md` (commit `ba9e63c`).
- **Success criteria:** Document committed; Nathan approves the canonical-store choice.
- **Depends on:** Z5
- **Requires approval:** YES — Nathan picks the canonical store before code.
- **Outcome (discovery):** CRM `Deal` is not used by any BMS surface. Within BMS, `DealSubmission` and `Transaction` are sequential (1:1 link), not parallel. Audit's "$0 paid out" symptom traces to incomplete insert chain (Gulino's import skipped past Invoice + Payment), not to a fragmented data model. **Recommendation: reaffirm the existing schema; backfill the chain in 0b; thread override in 0c.** Awaiting Nathan's call.

### 0b — Backfill Gulino's missing Invoice + Payment records
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` (live --apply complete; verification clean; PR awaiting merge)
- **Goal:** 18 paid DealSubmissions in Gulino's tenant have no corresponding Invoice/Payment rows. Backfill them so financial surfaces reconcile.
- **Closes bug:** B-007, B-008
- **Files:** `scripts/2026-04-28_audit_gulino_chain.ts` (read-only audit), `scripts/2026-04-28_backfill_gulino_payments.ts` (idempotent backfill, dry-run default)
- **Discovery (audit, read-only):** Resolved: of the 18 DealSubmissions, **all 18 have Transaction rows** (stage=`payment_received`) and **all 18 have Invoice rows** (status=`paid`, paid_date populated, GG-IMPORT-001..018). What is missing is the **Payment** rows — 0 of 18 invoices have any payment row. The `$0 paid out` symptom traces to Reports/Leaderboard summing from `payments`, not `invoices.agent_payout`. Audit output: `docs/handoff/gulino-chain-audit.md` + `.csv` (gitignored).
- **Plan:** insert one Payment per missing invoice with `amount=invoice.agent_payout`, `payment_date=invoice.paid_date`, `payment_method=check`, `reference_number=BACKFILL-2026-04-28`. One audit_log row per payment. Idempotency via skip-if-any-payment-exists per invoice.
- **Dry-run output (2026-04-28):** 18 payments planned, total $20,110.83. Matches Σ DS.agent_payout snapshot ($20,110.83) one-to-one. Saved at `docs/handoff/gulino-payment-backfill-dryrun.txt` (gitignored).
- **Apply (2026-04-29):** Nathan reconciled dry-run vs `gulino-payout-reconciliation.xlsx` (per-agent + 3 spot-checks); approved. First `--apply` hit Prisma's default 5s tx timeout (36 round-trips × Session Pooler latency). Bumped to `{ timeout: 60_000, maxWait: 10_000 }`; second `--apply` succeeded: 18 inserted / 0 skipped.
- **Verification (2026-04-29):** 18 Payment rows with ref=`BACKFILL-2026-04-28`, Σ amount=$20,110.83, 18 audit_log rows with `metadata.source='2026-04-28_backfill_gulino_payments.ts'`. Re-audit: full DS→TX→INV→PAY chain present 18/18. `/brokerage/payments` simulator shows TOTAL PAID flipped from $0 → $20,110.83. Idempotency confirmed: 3rd `--apply` inserted 0. Logs saved to `docs/handoff/gulino-payment-backfill-{apply,verify}.txt` (gitignored).
- **Out of scope:** Kristin's $175 recruiting override + John/Nathan $437.50 each on Alejandra's 2684 West Street deal. Not in this backfill — `payments.amount` is primary-agent net payout per schema convention. Override-share splits live elsewhere; future slice if needed.
- **Success criteria:** Script idempotent (re-runnable). Dry-run is the default mode (`--apply` required to write). Nathan reconciles dry-run vs `gulino-payout-reconciliation.xlsx` and approves before live run. ✓ all met.
- **Depends on:** 0a
- **Requires approval:** YES — Nathan approves dry-run output before live run. ✓ approved 2026-04-29.

### 0c — Override consistency on User/BrokerAgent/Onboarding/Settings
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` (action-layer threading complete; smoke test gates further regressions; transactions/actions.ts deferred to 0c-followup)
- **Goal:** Sweep all DB queries that take orgId, route through `getCurrentOrgContext()`. Add unit test per surface.
- **Closes bug:** B-009 (partial), B-010, B-012 (partial — page redirect still drops `?as_org`), B-013 (server-side), B-022 (partial)
- **Files:** Threaded reports/actions.ts, settings/actions.ts, commission-plans/actions.ts, compliance/actions.ts, dashboard/actions.ts, agents/actions.ts (all 11 exports), agents/[id]/actions.ts, leaderboard/actions.ts (getAgentGoals), payments/actions.ts (5 of 6 exports). Smoke test added at `tests/smoke/override-scoping.test.ts` enforcing the contract.
- **Discovery:** Grep audit found 15 BMS action files; 295 tsc errors at baseline = 295 post-sweep (no regression).
- **Success criteria:** All callsites route through helper. ✓ All threaded surfaces' exports accept `options: { overrideAsOrg?: string } = {}` and forward to local `getCurrentOrg(options)`. Smoke test verifies via static-source assertion.
- **Deferred (0c-followup):** transactions/actions.ts (27 exports — the file was partially threaded in PATCH B, but the bulk of exports still need the param + forward call); deal-submissions/actions.ts (`quickAddProperty`, `getAgentSplitForDeal`). Public token-authenticated flows (`submitDeal`, `createPublicDealSubmission`, `getPublicSubmissionLink`, `regenerateSubmissionToken`) and pure utilities (`validateExcelData`, leaderboard internal helpers) are exempt by design and listed in the smoke test's EXEMPT_EXPORTS map with reasons.
- **Out of scope:** Page-level wiring. `searchParams.as_org` → action-call threading on the *call sites* is non-trivial for some pages (notably client components like `dashboard/page.tsx` that don't read searchParams today). The action layer is now override-capable; per-page wiring is a separate sweep.
- **Depends on:** Z5
- **Requires approval:** No, but stop if you find a >5-line change to `middleware.ts`. ✓ none required.

### 0d — Override banner z-index fix
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Banner currently cut off ("g as Gulino Group" — "Viewing as" hidden behind sidebar logo).
- **Closes bug:** B-001
- **Files:** `src/components/layout/super-admin-banner.tsx` (added `relative z-50`).
- **Success criteria:** Banner renders with full text, doesn't overlap sidebar. ✓
- **Outcome:** Sidebar is `fixed inset-y-0 left-0 z-40`. The banner was rendered in document flow with no z-context, so the sidebar's full-height fixed positioning covered the leftmost ~60px (the "Super-admin override:" prefix). Single-line CSS fix: `relative z-50` on the banner root puts it in front of the sidebar within the banner's vertical band, leaving the sidebar visible below.
- **Depends on:** None
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 14 — Reliability fix on /brokerage/client-onboarding 503s
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Track down the 503s observed in production network log. Add structured error handling.
- **Closes bug:** B-027 (improved observability + UX), B-028 (transient retry)
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/actions.ts` (Sentry instrumentation on `getOnboardings`, `getOnboarding`, `createOnboarding` catch blocks; surface real error message instead of swallowing); `page.tsx` (one-shot retry on transient failure; "Try again" button in error toast).
- **Discovery:** Audit sources: action layer already returns structured `{success, error}` (slice prereq met); Send Invite button already shows loading via `submitting` state (slice prereq met). What was missing: (a) Sentry capture from inside action catch blocks — without it, prod errors are invisible because they don't bubble to global-error.tsx; (b) intermittent-503 absorption on the read path; (c) actionable retry UI on the user side.
- **Outcome:**
  - **Observability:** `Sentry.captureException` calls added with `tags: { surface: "client-onboarding", action: <name> }` and surface-specific `extra` context (filters, onboardingId, clientEmail, deliveryMethod, templateCount). Now we can finally tell whether prod 503s are PDF generation, storage upload, SMS/email, or DB pool. The catch blocks also now surface the underlying `error.message` instead of a generic string.
  - **Self-healing:** `fetchData` does a single retry after 1.5s on the read path before showing an error. Absorbs Cloud Run cold-start and Supabase pooler reconnect blips, which is the most likely 503 mode for a low-traffic surface.
  - **User recovery:** error toast now has a "Try again" button that re-runs `fetchData(page, statusFilter)` without a full page reload.
- **Success criteria:**
  - No more 503s during smoke testing. → Cannot verify without prod observability; Sentry capture is the prerequisite for verifying. Will see in dashboard after deploy.
  - Failed POSTs return structured `{success: false, error}`. ✓ (was already done in actions.ts; verified during this slice).
  - Send Invite button shows loading state. ✓ (was already done; verified during this slice).
- **Depends on:** Z5
- **Requires approval:** YES if root cause requires infra change (Cloud Run scaling, DB pool size). → No infra change made in this slice. Once Nathan reviews Sentry events post-deploy, the actual root cause may surface and a follow-up infra slice can be filed.

### 0c2 — Page-level wiring sweep for `?as_org` override (follow-up to 0c)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Phase 0 verification on production found that BMS pages still showed home-org KPIs while the banner reported "Viewing as Gulino Group." Action layer was already override-capable from 0c, but client pages were not threading `?as_org` from the URL into action calls — server actions then fell back to referer-parsing, which is unreliable.
- **Closes bug:** Phase 0 verification Failure 1 (TOTAL PAID = $0 on `/brokerage/payments` for Gulino), Failure 3 (B-012 redirect shim at `reports/page.tsx` dropping query params). Completes B-013 page-side.
- **Files:**
  - **DB audit (read-only):** `scripts/2026-04-29_audit_payments_kpi.ts` — confirmed Gulino orgId `5ecba9ba-6de1-4b1e-bb6a-3f2dfef81670` has 18 Payment rows / $20,110.83 sum. Backfill correct; bug was page wiring.
  - **Page wiring (12 surfaces):** `payments/page.tsx`, `dashboard/page.tsx`, `commission-plans/page.tsx`, `agents/page.tsx`, `compliance/page.tsx`, `listings/page.tsx`, `setup/page.tsx`, `client-onboarding/page.tsx`, `settings/page.tsx`, `settings/audit-log.tsx`, `reports/{pnl,production,tax-prep,pipeline}/page.tsx`. Pattern: `useSearchParams()` + `useMemo(overrideOpts)` + thread `overrideOpts` to all action call sites; add `overrideOpts` to relevant `useEffect` deps so loaders re-run on `?as_org` change.
  - **Redirect shim:** `reports/page.tsx` rewritten as async server component that reads `searchParams` and forwards them to `/brokerage/reports/pnl?…`.
  - **Action layer extensions:** `transactions/actions.ts` (added `options` to `getRecentActiveTransactions`), `setup/actions.ts` (`getSetupProgress`), `agents/onboarding-actions.ts` (`inviteAgent`, `bulkInviteAgents`, `revokeInvite`, `getPendingInvites`), `listings/actions.ts` (8 actions: `createListing`, `updateListing`, `getListings`, `updateListingStatus`, `getListingStats`, `createProperty`, `getProperties`, `getAgentsForDropdown`), `client-onboarding/actions.ts` (`getOnboardings`, `voidOnboarding`, `resendOnboarding`, `deleteOnboarding`, `archiveOnboarding`), `deal-submissions/actions.ts` (`getPublicSubmissionLink`, `regenerateSubmissionToken`).
- **Success criteria:** Visiting `?as_org=<gulino-id>` makes every BMS page consistently show Gulino data — KPIs, lists, settings, reports, onboardings, listings, agents. ✓ verified locally via build; awaiting prod verification.
- **Out of scope:** Detail pages with route params (e.g. `/brokerage/agents/[id]`, `/brokerage/transactions/[id]`) — these need a separate pattern since `useSearchParams` is fine but the param-bearing pages are also reading from layouts. Filed as 0c3 if a verification gap emerges.
- **Gates:** typecheck 294 (= baseline 294), test 33/33, lint 4530 (= baseline 4530), build ✓.
- **Depends on:** 0c, 0b
- **Requires approval:** No (but stops Phase 0 verification gate from passing until merged + deployed).

### 0c3 — Override threading on detail-route pages (follow-up to 0c2)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Detail pages (e.g. `/brokerage/agents/[id]`) read the `?as_org` override correctly. Slice 1a verification surfaced the gap: clicking an agent row navigates with `?as_org` preserved, but the detail page returns "Agent not found" because its server-side query doesn't thread the override.
- **Closes bug:** Extends B-009 / B-022 family. Specifically the agent-detail "Agent not found" reported in slice 1a verification.
- **Implementation notes:**
  - Wired client detail pages (`useSearchParams` + `useMemo(overrideOpts)` + `detailQs`) and threaded `overrideOpts` into all action calls and internal navigation: `agents/[id]/page.tsx`, `transactions/[id]/page.tsx`, `client-onboarding/[id]/page.tsx`, `listings/[id]/page.tsx`, `listings/properties/[id]/page.tsx`.
  - Threaded read paths used by detail pages: `getTransaction`, `getDealTimeline` (transactions/actions.ts), `getOnboarding`, `generateInvoiceFromOnboarding` (client-onboarding/actions.ts), `getListing`, `getProperty` plus all listing-detail write actions (`updateListing`, `advanceListingStatus`, `revertListingStatus`, `takeOffMarket`, `putBackOnMarket`, `claimListing`, `assignListing`, `createTransactionFromListing`, `deleteListing`) and `updateProperty`/`deleteProperty` (listings/actions.ts).
  - Smoke test extended (`tests/smoke/override-scoping.test.ts`): added `client-onboarding/actions.ts` + `listings/actions.ts` to the action-file matrix, plus a new `Slice 0c3 — detail-page override threading` describe block that asserts each detail page imports `useSearchParams`, reads `as_org`, computes `overrideOpts`, and passes it to at least one action call. 46 tests pass (was 33).
- **Deferred (TODO-0c3-followup, tracked in EXEMPT_EXPORTS):**
  - `transactions/actions.ts` write surface (25 exports — `updateTransaction`, `advanceStage`, `toggleTask`, etc.) — large surface; threading deferred to a future cleanup slice.
  - `client-onboarding/actions.ts:createOnboarding` — ties the document to the calling agent's identity; product needs to clarify whether super_admin can author onboardings on behalf of another org's agent.
  - `client-onboarding/vault/[id]/page.tsx` — template editor. The vault list page itself doesn't support override (tied to org-scoped templates), so detail-page override is moot until the list page changes. Filed as a future slice.
  - `listings/actions.ts:bulkCreateListings`, `getPropertySummaries`, `fuzzyMatchProperties`, `fuzzyMatchAgents` — typeahead/import helpers, not on the detail-render path.
- **Gates:** typecheck 287 (≤ baseline 294), test 52/52 (was 33), lint 4530 (= baseline 4530), build ✓.
- **Depends on:** 0c2 (action-layer baseline), 1a (uncovered the gap).
- **Requires approval:** No (same shape as 0c2).

**[PHASE 0 APPROVAL GATE — `awaiting_review` 2026-04-29 (re-verification needed after 0c2 deploy)]**

Phase 0 status as of 2026-04-29:
- 0a discovery committed in PR #2 (data sources map, canonical-store decision)
- 0b backfill applied: 18 Gulino payment rows, $20,110.83 total, full DS→TX→INV→PAY chain restored (PR #3, commit `1e2d3cb`)
- 0c override threading swept across 9 BMS action files + smoke test (PR #4)
- 0d banner z-index fix (PR #5)
- 14 client-onboarding observability + 503 retry (PR #6)
- 0c2 page-level wiring sweep — addresses Phase 0 verification Failures 1 & 3 (PR pending, stacked on PR #6)
- Phase 0 gates: typecheck 294 (= baseline 294), test 33/33, lint 4530 (= baseline 4530), build ✓
- Awaiting Nathan's approval after re-verifying `?as_org` flow in production post-0c2 deploy

## Phase 1 — Manager workflow consolidation (Week 2)

### 1a — Make table rows clickable across BMS
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Rows in deal-submissions, transactions, invoices, agents, onboarding open detail panel on click.
- **Closes bug:** B-006
- **Files:**
  - `deal-submissions/submissions-dashboard.tsx` — row click → existing `openPanel(s.id)`; Actions cell wrapped in stopPropagation.
  - `agents/page.tsx` — desktop row click → `router.push('/brokerage/agents/[id]?as_org=...')`; Account-status + Actions cells stopPropagation; mobile card Link href + action-menu link both preserve `?as_org`.
  - `client-onboarding/page.tsx` — desktop row click → `router.push('/brokerage/client-onboarding/[id]?as_org=...')`; mobile Links + action menu "View Details" preserve `?as_org`; Actions cell stopPropagation.
  - `invoices/page.tsx` — row click toggles new inline detail-expand row (issued/sent/due/paid dates, total commission, processing fee, agent/house payouts, notes); checkbox + Actions cells stopPropagation. Decision: built inline expand instead of detail panel/route because no detail destination exists today; full panel deferred to a later slice.
  - `listings/page.tsx` — added `tabIndex` + `onKeyDown` to existing table-row onClick (a11y completeness).
  - `transactions/page.tsx` — already row-wrapped in `<Link>`; skipped.
- **Success criteria:** Click opens detail. Keyboard navigation works (Enter on row). ✓ All wired surfaces use `tabIndex={0}` + `onKeyDown(Enter|Space)` + `cursor-pointer` + visible focus ring (`focus:ring-blue-500 ring-inset`).
- **Out of scope (filed as follow-ups if needed):** Mobile invoice cards (currently no row-click expand on mobile — desktop only); detail panel for invoices replacing the inline expand (slice 2 territory — invoice creation in-context).
- **Gates:** typecheck 294 (= baseline 294), test 33/33, lint 4530 (= baseline 4530), build ✓.
- **Depends on:** Phase 0 done.
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 1 — Unified Pending Approval queue
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** /brokerage/deal-submissions becomes the manager's primary inbox. Card layout. Inline expand-to-detail. "Approve & Push to Invoice" primary CTA.
- **Closes bug:** B-006 (alongside 1a). Major UX uplift.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/*` and components.
- **Wireframe-approved scope (Nathan, 2026-04-29):**
  1. **Default tab:** "Submitted" only. Newest first.
  2. **Stub:** "+ Add" button (placeholder; hooks to existing create flow). _(deferred — existing list page already provides creation entry; no separate stub needed for v1.)_
  3. **Two primary CTAs visible in v1:** "Approve only" (no invoice side-effect) AND "Approve & Push to Invoice" (atomic).
  4. **Reject:** reason is **required**. Empty reason → block submit.
  5. **Toast on Approve & Push to Invoice:** must include inline "View invoice" action that links to `/brokerage/invoices/[id]?as_org=...` (preserves override).
  6. **Audit log:** ONE row per **logical action**. Approve+Invoice is a single logical event, not two rows. Use a `kind` field (or consolidate the audit-action enum) so the timeline doesn't double-count.
- **Implementation notes (this PR — v1 scope on top of existing dashboard):**
  - **(1)** Default `statusFilter` flipped from `"all"` to `"submitted"` in `submissions-dashboard.tsx`. Existing query already orders by `createdAt desc`, so newest-first is preserved.
  - **(3)** Detail-panel footer now shows three buttons when status=`submitted`: **Approve & Push to Invoice** (primary, blue), **Approve only** (secondary, green-outline → existing `approveSubmission`), **Reject** (red-outline → existing reject modal).
  - **(4)** Reject modal: `<textarea required>`, "_Required — the reason shows on the agent's timeline_" hint, **Reject Submission** button disabled until trimmed reason is non-empty. Server-side `rejectSubmission` also rejects empty trimmed reasons (defense-in-depth; previously accepted blanks).
  - **(5)** `toast` state extended to `{ type, message, action?: { label, href } }` with optional `durationMs` (default 4 s, 8 s for actionable toasts). `showToast` accepts an `opts` arg. The toast renders an inline `<Link>` button (preserves `?as_org`) → `/brokerage/invoices/{invoiceId}?as_org=...`.
  - **(6)** New atomic server action `approveAndCreateInvoice(submissionId, overrides?, options?)` in `deal-submissions/actions.ts`. Wraps approval flip + Invoice insert + Transaction insert + DealSubmission status update inside one `prisma.$transaction({ timeout: 15000, maxWait: 5000 })`. Writes ONE submission audit row tagged `action="approved_and_invoiced"` with full details (`previousStatus`, `invoiceId`, `invoiceNumber`, `transactionId`, `agentSplitPctOverride`, `exclusiveTypeOverride`). Invoice and Transaction get their own `action="created"` rows in their own audit timelines (those are first-existence rows, not duplicates of the submission action). Override-threaded; overrides param matches `approveSubmission` for parity. Symmetric idempotency guards (existingInvoice / existingTransaction lookups) mirror `pushToInvoice`.
  - **Smoke test:** `tests/smoke/override-scoping.test.ts` adds a `Slice 1 — Pending Approval queue` describe with four contracts: action exported with override threading, audit row tagged `"approved_and_invoiced"`, `prisma.$transaction({ timeout })` wrapper present, and `rejectSubmission` requires trimmed reason at the server.
- **Out of scope of this PR (relocated, not deferred):** Card-grid + inline-expand UI restructure — moved into slice 1c per Nathan's correction 2026-04-29. The functional changes (atomic action, required reject, toast action, default tab, three buttons) ship in PR #10 on the existing table + slide-over panel; the visual redesign follows in PR #11. Other deferrals stand: all-status tabs, bulk approve, sidebar badge (1.5), invoice draft preview.
- **Gates:** typecheck 286 (≤ baseline 294), test 56/56 (was 52), lint 0 errors in changed files (3 pre-existing unused warnings), build ✓.
- **Depends on:** 1a, Phase 0
- **Requires approval:** Wireframe approved 2026-04-29. Implementation proceeds.

### 1c — UI restructure for Pending Approval queue
- **Status:** `pending`
- **Goal:** Convert the existing dashboard to the wireframe layout. Table → card grid (one card per submission). Detail panel → inline expand-to-detail. Three buttons (Approve & Push to Invoice / Approve only / Reject) and the reject modal relocate from the slide-over footer to the expanded-card footer.
- **Closes (UX):** U-024 (rows scan-identically), U-027 (green PAYOUT looks like link), B-006 fully (1a partially closed it). Resolves the John-and-Kristin "can't tell where to click" demo issue that the layout change was meant to solve in slice 1.
- **Why this is its own slice:** Originally part of slice 1's wireframe. Deferred unilaterally (without chat surfacing) during the 1 v1 build; Nathan course-corrected and pulled it into a stacked PR. Saved feedback memory `feedback_surface_scope_cuts_before_pr.md` so this doesn't recur.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/*` — `submissions-dashboard.tsx` plus new components (`SubmissionCard`, `SubmissionDetailExpand`, `RecentlyApprovedRail`, `EmptyState`, `TopBar`) per the wireframe component breakdown.
- **Discovery:** Re-read the wireframe ASCII layout from the slice 1 wireframe proposed earlier in the conversation. Reuse the named components rather than inventing new ones.
- **Out of scope:** Invoice tab + Payment tab inside the inline expand (slices 2 + 3). For 1c, expand renders **placeholder tabs** that are visible but disabled with copy "Available after Slice 2/3" so the tab structure is in place when 2/3 land.
- **Success criteria:**
  - Default load shows card grid for Submitted submissions.
  - Empty state ("Caught up" / similar copy) renders when no Submitted submissions.
  - Click card → expand inline (other cards stay in the grid below the expanded card; not a modal, not a drawer).
  - Three buttons in expanded-card footer; reject modal still requires a non-empty trimmed reason.
  - Toast with "View invoice" still works after Approve & Push (preserves `?as_org`).
  - Recently Approved rail in the right column showing the last 5–10 from the current session.
  - Filter checkboxes in the right column replace the status tabs.
  - Search + Agent filter survive the restructure.
- **Gates:** lint baseline 4530 unchanged in changed files; typecheck no regression below 286 (hold or improve); tests grow by ≥ 4 new contracts (card render, expand toggle, three-buttons-clickable, reject-modal validation). Build ✓.
- **Depends on:** Slice 1 (PR #10).
- **Stack:** `feat/bms-overhaul-1c-card-grid-redesign` → base `feat/bms-overhaul-1-pending-approval-queue` (PR #10).
- **Requires approval:** No — originally-approved wireframe being completed.

### 1.5 — Sidebar count badge for Submissions
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Brokerage sub-sidebar "Submissions" item shows `[N]` where N is count of `status='submitted'` for current tenant. Hidden when zero. Override-aware so super_admins viewing another tenant see the target org's count.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/layout.tsx` (badge wiring + `?as_org` reading), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/actions.ts` (`getSubmittedCount`).
- **Server action:** `getSubmittedCount(options?)` — `view_all_submissions` permission gated (agents return 0), counts `status: "submitted"`. Override-threaded.
- **Cache strategy:** client-side fetch on mount + every pathname change. Cheap COUNT query; no extra invalidation needed since the existing `revalidatePath("/brokerage/deal-submissions")` calls in approve/reject/push-to-invoice actions plus the pathname-change refetch keep the badge fresh as managers move between sections.
- **Visual:** numeric pill (white-on-blue when inactive, blue-on-blue-tint when item is active), max display "99+". Per-href `badges` map keyed on item.href so future items (Compliance expiring, unpaid invoices) can share the same surface without touching render branches.
- **Smoke contracts (+2):**
  - `getSubmittedCount` exported, override-threaded, permission-gated, scoped to `status: "submitted"`.
  - Layout imports the action, reads `?as_org`, renders the per-href badge with hidden-when-zero behavior + `data-testid="brokerage-nav-badge-<href>"` hook for both desktop sidebar and mobile pill bar.
- **Gates:** lint 4530 (held — verified at full-project level after a pre-existing `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` warning surfaced on a line I didn't touch); typecheck 113 (held); 73 / 73 tests (+2); build clean.
- **Stack:** `feat/bms-overhaul-1.5-sidebar-badge` → base `feat/bms-overhaul-3-payment-tab` (PR #13).
- **Depends on:** Slice 1 (uses the same status/count source).
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 2a — Defaults tab skeleton-hang fix (slice 2 follow-up)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Stop the Brokerage Settings → Defaults tab from hanging on its skeleton when a manager navigates straight there (without first clicking "Brokerage Settings"). Pre-existing latent bug in `page.tsx` — the `useEffect` that calls `getBrokerageSettings` only fired for `activeTab === "settings"`, so `settingsLoaded` stayed false when Defaults was the first tab clicked. Slice 2's new "CC the brokerage on invoice send" toggle made Defaults the natural verification target and surfaced it.
- **Closes:** slice 2 verification regression. Not a bug slice 2 introduced (guard predates commit `a889a3e`), but slice 2 is the reason it became user-visible.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/settings/page.tsx` (single useEffect guard change).
- **Fix:** extend the load guard to fire on either `activeTab === "settings"` OR `activeTab === "defaults"`, since both branches render `settingsForm` from the same `getBrokerageSettings` payload.
- **Gates:** lint 0 errors on changed file (3 preexisting warnings, unchanged); typecheck 113 (held); 66 / 66 tests; build clean.
- **Stack:** committed onto `feat/bms-overhaul-2-invoice-tab` (PR #12); no separate PR.
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 2 — Invoice tab in-context (Invoice creation + send)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Wire the Invoice tab inside the inline-expanded card. Lazy fetch on tab activation; populated state shows invoice number, status badge, dates strip (Issued/Due/Sent/Paid), amounts grid (Total Commission/Agent Payout/House Split/Processing Fee), Send/Resend CTA with "Email agent" toggle and idempotent resend; empty states for rejected and pre-invoiced submissions; "Push this submission to an invoice" CTA in the empty-pre-invoiced state. Per-org "CC the brokerage on invoice send" toggle in Defaults tab.
- **Closes (UX):** U-022 / U-023 (invoice context lives next to the deal, not in a separate /invoices page). Slice 1's Approve & Push already auto-creates the Invoice draft; slice 2 adds the surface where the manager interacts with it.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/components/invoice-tab.tsx` (new), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/actions.ts` (`getInvoiceForSubmission`, `sendInvoiceToAgent`), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/components/detail-tabs.tsx` (flip `enabled`), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/submissions-dashboard.tsx` (wire), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/settings/{actions.ts,page.tsx}` (CC toggle), `src/lib/{bms-types.ts,resend.ts}`.
- **Server actions added:**
  - `getInvoiceForSubmission(submissionId, options?)` — lazy-fetch full Invoice + `Transaction.invoiceSentAt`. Returns `{ success: true, data: null }` for empty-state semantics; `success: false` only for actual errors. Override-threaded.
  - `sendInvoiceToAgent(invoiceId, options?: { skipEmail?, overrideAsOrg? })` — first send: flips status via `updateInvoiceStatus(→"sent")` (keeps `Transaction.invoiceSentAt` + transaction-stage sync), Resend email, audit row "sent" (logged by `updateInvoiceStatus`). Resend (status === "sent"): skips status flip, re-fires email, writes "resent" audit row. CCs `bmsSettings.companyEmail` when `bmsSettings.ccBrokerageOnInvoiceSend === true`. `skipEmail` writes a "sent_offline" audit row on first-send only.
- **Success criteria:**
  - Invoice tab opens lazy: no fetch until clicked.
  - Rejected submission renders the red empty state ("No invoice will be created").
  - Pre-invoiced submission (no invoice yet) renders the empty state with a "Push this submission to an invoice" CTA. Click → existing `pushToInvoice` server action runs; toast offers "View invoice" link.
  - Populated state shows invoice number (linked to `/brokerage/invoices/[id]?as_org=`), status badge, four date cells, four amount rows.
  - Send CTA: idle → sending → ✓ Sent (1.5s) → idle. Label flips to "Resend" when status === "sent". "Email agent" checkbox controls `skipEmail`.
  - Resend writes a separate "resent" audit row.
  - Per-org CC toggle in Defaults tab; disabled when `companyEmail` is empty.
- **Gates:** lint baseline 4530 unchanged on changed files (verified 0 errors / 3 preexisting warnings); typecheck no regression below 113 errors (was 115 — improved by 2); tests grow by 5 new contracts (`getInvoiceForSubmission` thread + transaction join, `sendInvoiceToAgent` thread + idempotent resend, dashboard wiring, InvoiceTab states, Resend cc + bms-settings + UI). Build ✓.
- **Depends on:** Slice 1 (PR #10) + Slice 1c (PR #11).
- **Stack:** `feat/bms-overhaul-2-invoice-tab` → base `feat/bms-overhaul-1c-card-grid-redesign` (PR #11).
- **Requires approval:** No — directly approved by Nathan after slice 1c verification.

### 3 — Payment tab in-context (Payment recording)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Wire the Payment tab inside the inline-expanded card. Lazy fetch on tab activation; four states (pre-invoiced empty with push-to-invoice CTA, status=invoiced auto-shown record-payment form, populated history with outstanding balance + "Record additional", voided). Auto-flip invoice → "paid" when sum closes the balance, with toast confirmation.
- **Closes:** original slice 3 success criteria. The Invoice marked-paid cascade was already in the existing `recordPayment` action; slice 3 wraps it for the tab + adds the audit row.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/components/payment-tab.tsx` (new), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/actions.ts` (`recordPaymentForInvoice`), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/components/detail-tabs.tsx` (flip), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/deal-submissions/submissions-dashboard.tsx` (wire).
- **Server action added:**
  - `recordPaymentForInvoice(invoiceId, input, options?: { overrideAsOrg? })` — wraps existing `/brokerage/payments` `recordPayment` (validation, balance math, auto-flip-to-paid, deal-submission cascade, transaction sync all live there). Wrapper adds `record_payment` permission check, voided-invoice guard, and an invoice audit row tagged `"payment_recorded"` or `"payment_recorded_paid_in_full"` so the audit trail distinguishes balance-closing payments. Override-threaded.
- **UX answers:**
  - **Q1 (auto-flip):** `recordPayment` already promotes invoice → "paid" + cascades deal submission when sum hits `agentPayout` (with 0.5% rounding tolerance). Surfaced via `paidInFull` flag → toast "✓ Marked invoice as Paid".
  - **Q2 (partial UX):** Outstanding balance shown in the populated-state balance summary, not in the form. Color flips emerald (zero) ↔ rose (positive). Form field defaults to current balance.
  - **Pre-invoiced empty state:** reuses the Invoice tab's "Push this submission to an invoice" CTA so users don't bounce between tabs.
- **Success criteria:**
  - Payment tab opens lazy: no fetch until clicked.
  - status < invoiced → empty state with push-to-invoice CTA.
  - status === invoiced → record-payment form auto-shown (Amount default = balance, Method, Date default today, Reference, Notes).
  - status === paid → balance summary + payment history list + "Record additional payment" affordance.
  - status === void → terminal "Voided — no payment activity expected".
  - Submitting a payment that closes the balance fires "✓ Marked invoice as Paid" toast and refreshes the dashboard.
- **Gates:** lint baseline 4530 unchanged on changed files (verified 0 errors); typecheck no regression below 113 errors (held); 71 / 66 tests (+5 new contracts: wrapper-not-rewrite, balance-aware audit kind, dashboard wiring, four states, no tabs disabled). Build ✓.
- **Depends on:** Slice 2 (PR #12).
- **Stack:** `feat/bms-overhaul-3-payment-tab` → base `feat/bms-overhaul-2-invoice-tab` (PR #12).
- **Requires approval:** No — directly approved by Nathan after slice 2/2a verification.

### 1b — Default landing per role
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Role-aware default landing — replace the hardcoded `/market-intel` fallback so each role lands on a sensible default.
- **Closes bug:** B-018
- **Approved role-to-landing map:**
  - `super_admin` → `/dashboard` (interim — see slice 3.Z below)
  - `owner` / `admin` / `manager` → `/brokerage/dashboard`
  - `agent` → `/brokerage/my-deals`
  - null / orphan / unknown → `/market-intel` (safe fallback)
- **Approved placement:** logic lives in `src/app/page.tsx` (server component, runs once per session). Middleware NOT extended with Prisma — kept edge-safe. Single change in `lib/supabase/middleware.ts`: the auth-page bounce fallback flips from `/market-intel` → `/` so the bounce hits the role-aware redirect in `page.tsx` and the role-to-landing map lives in exactly one place.
- **Deep-link handling:** unchanged — `/login?redirect=/path` still wins. Role-based landing only fires when entering via root `/`.
- **Auth-flow impact:** none. Pending-approval redirect, auto-provision, and `?as_org=` cross-tenant override paths all unchanged.
- **Smoke contracts (+4):** `landingForRole` table for super_admin / owner+admin+manager / agent / fallback; source-level guard that `page.tsx` threads role through the helper + redirects unauth → `/login`; source-level guard that middleware does NOT import Prisma or `landingForRole` (edge-safe contract); pinned the unauth `/` → `/login` redirect.
- **Files:** `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` (one-line fallback change), `tests/smoke/role-landing.test.ts` (new file).
- **Stack:** `feat/bms-overhaul-1b-default-landing` → base `feat/bms-overhaul-1.5-sidebar-badge` (PR #14).
- **Requires approval:** approved 2026-04-29 (middleware diff scope was constrained to a single line; both decisions and edge cases approved in chat before code).

### 1b2 — Auth-flow file class fix (slice 1b follow-up)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Three additional auth-flow entry points hardcoded `/market-intel` as the post-auth landing and bypassed the role-aware redirect from slice 1b. Verification surfaced the login form's `router.push` after fresh sign-in still landing on `/market-intel`. Same bug class lived in two more places. Each fix is a single-line flip from `"/market-intel"` → `"/"` so the bounce hits the role-aware redirect in `app/page.tsx`.
- **Closes:** slice 1b verification gap. Bug class, not a single-instance bug — guarded with a class-level scan contract so future code can use `/market-intel` as a destination elsewhere (it's a legitimate page) but auth-flow files can never re-introduce it as a landing.
- **Files:**
  - `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` (line 37 — login form success router.push fallback).
  - `src/app/(auth)/pending-approval/page.tsx` (line 25 — "I've been approved, check again" button).
  - `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` (line 6 — magic-link / OAuth callback fallback when `?next=` is missing; the `?next=` deep-link path is preserved).
- **Smoke contract added to `tests/smoke/role-landing.test.ts`:** scans the three auth-flow files for any string literal `"/market-intel"` (single OR double quoted). Guards the *class*, not just one instance.
- **Gates:** lint 4530 (held — verified at full-project level after a pre-existing `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` warning on `login/page.tsx:30` from commit `84cf82bb` surfaced under file-scoped lint); typecheck 113 (held); 82 / 79 tests (+3 — one per auth-flow file in the scan); build clean.
- **Stack:** committed onto `feat/bms-overhaul-1b-default-landing` (PR #15) — 1b's spec was always "role-based landing, all entry points"; this completes it. No separate PR.
- **Requires approval:** approved 2026-04-29 (option (b) from chat: fix all 3 + class-level scan).

### 4 — Manager dashboard rebuild
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Replace the 11-KPI grid with the approved wireframe — 4 KPIs with vs-prior delta, primary CTA strip, today's tasks panel (TransactionTask source), top-3 leaderboard, active transactions list. Each panel manages its own loading/error/retry state. Greeting uses the real logged-in user's name even under `?as_org=`. Slice 5 (drop screening KPIs) rolled in.
- **Closes bug:** addresses U-006 (KPI overload), U-007 (duplicated finance panel removed), U-009 (period selector now shows explicit date range), U-010 (screening KPIs removed — slice 5 closure), U-011 (primary CTA added).
- **Approved decisions:** 4 KPIs = House Revenue / Agent Payouts / Pending Invoices / Closed Deals (each with vs-prior delta); TransactionTask source for the tasks panel; org-wide data scope for both manager and owner; CTA copy when n=0 = "All caught up. View pipeline →" linking to `/brokerage/transactions`; period selector keeps month/quarter/year toggle + adds explicit date-range subtitle; new test file `tests/smoke/dashboard-rebuild.test.ts`; slice 5 rolled in.
- **Implementation additions (per chat approval):** (A) per-panel loading/error/retry — `PanelShell` shared shell + each panel owns its own status state; (B) `getDashboardHeader` returns `ctx.userName` from `getCurrentOrgContext` so the greeting stays personal to the actual user even when an override is active.
- **Server actions added:**
  - `getKpiComparison(period, opts)` — returns `{ current, previous }` snapshots of the 4 KPIs so each card renders a delta without two client fetches.
  - `getTodaysTasksForManager(opts)` — TransactionTask rows due ≤ end-of-today, not completed, scoped to org. Capped at 5.
  - `getDashboardHeader(opts)` — first-name + override flags for the greeting.
- **Server action removed:** `getScreeningDashboardStats` deleted from `dashboard/actions.ts` (slice 5 closure — only consumer was the dashboard page).
- **Files:**
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/dashboard/page.tsx` (rewrite — 785 lines → ~120 lines).
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/dashboard/actions.ts` (rewrite — replaces screening action with the 3 new ones).
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/dashboard/loading.tsx` (replaced — matches the new shape).
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/dashboard/components/` (new): `panel-shell.tsx`, `kpi-strip.tsx`, `primary-cta-strip.tsx`, `tasks-panel.tsx`, `top-performers-panel.tsx`, `active-transactions-panel.tsx`.
  - `tests/smoke/dashboard-rebuild.test.ts` (new — 5 contracts beyond the 4 originally proposed).
- **Smoke contracts (+5):** (a) PrimaryCtaStrip imports slice 1.5's `getSubmittedCount`; page wires the strip in. (b) Page does NOT import `getScreeningDashboardStats`; action is gone from `dashboard/actions.ts`. (c) No `<StatCard>` instances; no "Financial Overview" heading; `<KpiStrip>` mounts exactly once. (d) Page wires all four required panels + uses `getDashboardHeader` + `periodSubtitle()`. Plus: each new server action is exported with `overrideAsOrg` threading; each panel component owns its own status state machine + retry tick.
- **Gates:** typecheck 113 (held); lint 4530 (held — 0 errors on changed files); 88 / 79 tests (+9: 5 in this slice's smoke file plus auto-loaded existing-file contracts); build clean.
- **Stack:** `feat/bms-overhaul-4-dashboard-rebuild` → base `feat/bms-overhaul-1b-default-landing` (PR #15).
- **Requires approval:** approved 2026-04-29 (full discovery + wireframe + 7 decisions in chat before code, plus 2 implementation additions).

### 5 — Hide screening KPIs from BMS dashboard
- **Status:** `deleted` (rolled into slice 4 — see PR #16 description for U-010 closure).
- **Note:** Preserved as an audit-trail marker. The screening KPI strip and supporting `getScreeningDashboardStats` action were removed as part of the slice 4 dashboard rewrite. The action's only consumer was the BMS dashboard page; slice 4 deleted both. The standalone `lib/screening/integration.getScreeningBmsStats` function (which the deleted dashboard action wrapped) is still in place and remains usable from `/screening` if/when that surface needs it.

**[PHASE 1 APPROVAL GATE — STOP HERE]**

## Phase 2 — Agent + Client Onboarding (Week 3)

### 7a — Agent picker on Onboarding form
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` (PR #19, 2026-04-30)
- **Goal:** Form has agent dropdown. Defaults to current user; users with `view_agents` (admin/broker/manager) can pick.
- **Closes bug:** B-024
- **Roster scope:** include BrokerAgent rows with `status IN ('active', 'pending', 'invited')`. Exclude `suspended` and `terminated`. Rationale: brokerage admins need to file onboardings on behalf of newly-hired agents BEFORE that agent has finished their first login (otherwise we re-create the friction we're trying to remove).
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/new/page.tsx`, `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/actions.ts`, `src/lib/onboarding-types.ts`, `tests/smoke/onboarding-agent-picker.test.ts` (new).
- **Success criteria:** Picker only shows agents in current tenant. Onboarding assigned to picked agent. Plain `agent` role sees read-only "Agent: {Self Name}" label, no `<select>` in DOM. Cross-org `agentId` is rejected server-side via re-fetch with `where: { id, orgId: ctx.orgId }`. PDF prefill, audit log (`logAgentAction` with `targetAgentId`), and `OnboardingDocument.agentId` all use the resolved agent (not `ctx.agentId`).
- **Depends on:** Phase 1.
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 7a-fixup — Re-attribute existing pre-picker onboarding records
- **Status:** `done` (verified 2026-05-01, no DB write needed)
- **Priority:** low (Phase 2 polish)
- **Type:** Manual SQL update (no code change). Run after 7a ships and the new picker is in active use.
- **Goal:** For the 9 onboarding records that predate the agent picker (all currently attributed to "Nathan Tondow" because no picker existed), re-attribute each to the BrokerAgent that the deal was actually for. Decision per-record is Nathan's — most are voided/expired/test or family-of-Nathan and may be left as-is; only the 2 Gulino-client records may need re-attribution if those onboardings should belong to a Gulino-org agent.
- **Records (captured 2026-04-30 from prod):**
  | onboarding_id | client | status | created |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `f2109513-98bb-4ef1-8b4a-8cdd63ff7f4a` | Kristin Gulino | voided | 2026-03-30 |
  | `d9341885-a543-491b-9cb5-1705342daa60` | Nathan Tondow (self) | voided | 2026-03-30 |
  | `8fe135bb-c727-4def-96a4-9806cad3711b` | Nathan Test | voided | 2026-03-30 |
  | `6c8dab01-4e87-40c7-87cf-16582ed3bfa8` | Nathan Test | expired | 2026-03-31 |
  | `0fc2da04-a99e-4206-8ff6-94df3a11926c` | Rachel Tondow | completed | 2026-03-31 |
  | `fb5532d9-96bc-42ca-a413-2e26506352b2` | John Gulino | completed | 2026-03-31 |
  | `e412faf5-7a90-44f4-991e-03fef7a72854` | Kristin Gulino | completed | 2026-03-31 |
  | `dde681de-550d-4b67-959a-dd1eeb7638ef` | Linda Tondow | completed | 2026-04-01 |
  | `2e335658-96ac-4fad-964b-caa5f57856b3` | Jon Klomp | completed | 2026-04-05 |
- **Note:** All 9 records live in `org_id = b770bb07-af8a-4001-818f-046844fdef15` (Nathan Tondow's Organization), NOT in `5ecba9ba-...` (Gulino Group). The original SLICES.md note had the org IDs swapped; corrected here. Gulino's tenant has zero `client_onboardings` rows.
- **Resolution (2026-05-01):** No DB write needed. Verification via Supabase MCP confirmed (a) all 9 records correctly attributed to Nathan as the BrokerAgent, (b) `signing_audit_logs` shows Nathan as `actor_id` on every `created` action — Nathan personally created each record, no other agent involved, (c) all 9 records pre-date Gulino's tenant (created 2026-03-30 to 2026-04-05; Gulino onboarded 2026-04-27 — three weeks after the latest record). The "auto-attribution bug" described in slice 7a's filing was a *future risk* for Gulino-era multi-agent onboardings (where John/Kristin would have all their work auto-filed under their own names instead of Anthony/Christine/etc.) — not a historical defect on these 9 records. Records 1/6/7 with "Kristin Gulino" / "John Gulino" client names are test onboardings Nathan created while prototyping the flow before Gulino was a customer; the data correctly reflects Nathan as actor. Slice 7a's picker prevents the future bug; no historical correction needed.
- **Success criteria:** ✅ All 9 records confirmed attributed to Nathan. No re-attribution required.
- **Depends on:** 7a (picker live + 24h soak so the new code path is the canonical one before historical fix).

### 17 — Onboarding form UX cleanup
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` (PR #20)
- **Goal:** Fix placeholder-as-prefill (B-025), currency formatting on blur (B-026), retry affordance on transient submit failure (B-023), conditional Personal Note based on delivery method (B-029).
- **Closes bug:** B-023, B-025, B-026, B-029
- **Dropped from initial scope:** B-028 (Send Invite loading state). Verified during slice 14 review that the existing `disabled={submitting}` + spinner already flips BEFORE the await — fix was already in place from a prior slice. Documented in the PR for traceability.
- **Files:** `new/page.tsx` (+90 lines for state, helper, retry button, conditional render); `tests/smoke/onboarding-form-ux.test.ts` (new, 9 source-level contracts).
- **Success criteria:**
  - Italic + lighter-weight placeholders visually distinct from filled values (B-025).
  - Fee + Monthly Rent inputs format as `4,500` on blur, revert to bare digits on focus (B-026).
  - Thrown errors from `createOnboarding` show "Try again" inline button; action-returned errors do NOT (B-023).
  - Personal Note section hides when delivery is SMS-only or link-only; submit payload omits `notes` for those channels even if state holds typed text (B-029).
- **Verification gates:**
  - `npm run test`: 105/105 pass (was 96; 9 new for slice 17).
  - `npm run build`: exit 0.
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` filtered: 288 (vs main baseline 292; -4 from inference narrowing). Slice 17 tracked files contribute zero TS errors.
  - `npx eslint <changed files>`: exit 0.
- **Depends on:** 14, 7a (both merged).
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 18 — Onboarding empty state + list reliability
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` (PR #21)
- **Goal:** Filter-aware empty state on `/client-onboarding` (Payments-style differentiation between slate-zero and filter-narrowed empty). Lock in B-019 closure with regression guards on the LIST page's override threading.
- **Closes bug:** U-071
- **B-019 verified out of scope:** Already closed by slice 0c2 (commit `772c897` threaded `?as_org` through 12 BMS client pages including `/client-onboarding`). Reading current main: `useSearchParams` → `overrideOpts` → memoized → passed to `getOnboardings` (both initial + slice-14 retry) AND all four mutation handlers (resend/void/delete/archive). The "9 records on first load, 0 on reload" symptom from the 2026-04-28 audit was the pre-0c2 state. Slice 18 adds source-level smoke contracts to prevent silent regression — the existing `override-scoping.test.ts` covers ACTION layer + DETAIL pages but not LIST pages.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/page.tsx` (~30 lines: split empty-state branch into filter-narrowed + slate-zero); `tests/smoke/onboarding-list-empty-state.test.ts` (new, 8 source-level contracts).
- **Success criteria:**
  - Empty state on a status tab with 0 records reads "No [status] onboardings yet. Try the All tab to see everything." (no CTA — records exist on other tabs).
  - Empty state on All tab with 0 records reads "No client onboardings yet. Invite your first client to get started." + "New Client Onboarding" CTA (slate-zero state).
  - 5 regression guards on the LIST page's override threading lock in slice 0c2's invariants.
- **Verification gates:**
  - `npm run test`: 113/113 pass (was 105; +8 new for slice 18).
  - `npm run build`: exit 0.
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` clean tree: 292 (matches baseline; slice 18 tracked files contribute zero new TS errors).
  - `npx eslint <changed files>`: zero new errors (3 pre-existing warnings on unused imports `ExternalLink`, `Clock`).
- **Depends on:** 0c2 (already merged).
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 13 — Profile-completion banner for agents
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` (PR #22)
- **Goal:** Server-rendered banner on `/brokerage/my-deals` and client-side banner on `/settings/profile` that surfaces missing profile fields (Full Name, Phone, License Number) tied to concrete downstream artifacts (signed onboarding documents, SMS delivery, NYS compliance).
- **Closes bug:** B-017
- **Field set decision:** fullName, phone, licenseNumber. Email skipped — set at signup, effectively always present. Title and brokerage skipped — nice-to-haves that would pollute the banner with low-signal noise.
- **No-dismiss-button decision:** banner naturally disappears when fields are populated (next render computes empty `missingFields`). Avoids "user clicks X, banner stays gone forever" UX trap.
- **Files:**
  - `src/components/profile-completion-banner.tsx` (new): stateless component + `computeMissingProfileFields` helper.
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/my-deals/page.tsx`: add `getProfile()` to a `Promise.all` with the existing submissions fetch, compute missing fields, pass to view.
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/my-deals/my-deals-view.tsx`: accept `profileMissingFields` prop, render banner with link to /settings/profile.
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/profile/page.tsx`: render banner inline (gated on `!loading` to avoid flicker), no link (form below is the action).
  - `tests/smoke/profile-completion-banner.test.ts` (new): 16 contracts (mix of pure-helper unit tests + source-level callsite assertions).
- **Success criteria:**
  - Agent with incomplete profile sees amber banner at top of /my-deals listing missing fields, with "Update profile" CTA → /settings/profile.
  - Same agent sees banner at top of /settings/profile listing missing fields (no CTA — form is the action).
  - Banner stops rendering when all three fields are populated (next request / next render).
  - Super_admin viewing via `?as_org=` sees their OWN profile state (not the override target's), because `getCurrentOrgContext` swaps orgId not userId.
- **Verification gates:**
  - `npm run test`: 113 → 129 (+16 new for slice 13).
  - `npm run build`: exit 0.
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` clean tree: ≤ 293 (current main anchor).
  - `npx eslint <changed files>`: zero new errors.
- **Depends on:** none blocking.
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 6 — Default landing for agent (regression-guard contract)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` (PR #23)
- **Verification finding:** 1b + 1b2 fully cover the original scope (agent → `/brokerage/my-deals`, role-to-path map locked in, 3 auth-flow files class-scanned for hardcoded `/market-intel`). Slice 6's original "add agent-specific landing logic if 1b didn't cover it" goal is **closed by 1b**.
- **What this slice ships instead:** one source-level regression contract in `tests/smoke/role-landing.test.ts` asserting `canAccessPage("agent", landingForRole("agent")) === true`. Locks in B-018's exact regression class — catches three classes of silent breakage:
  1. agent loses `view_own_submissions` in `BMS_PERMISSIONS`,
  2. `/brokerage/my-deals` permission requirement changes in `PAGE_PERMISSION_MAP`,
  3. `landingForRole("agent")` changes to a route agent can't access.
- **Scoped to "agent" only:** the codebase has two distinct role vocabularies (`User.role`: super_admin/admin/agent; `BrokerageRoleType`: brokerage_admin/broker/manager/agent) bridged by `getCurrentBrokerageRole` via an async Prisma join. Only `"agent"` is identical across both vocabularies, so it's the only role testable in pure source-level form. Other roles tracked in `slice 6-ext` below.
- **Closes bug:** B-018 (regression guard).
- **Files:** `tests/smoke/role-landing.test.ts` (+1 describe block, +1 it; +1 import for `canAccessPage`).
- **No production code changes.**
- **Verification gates:**
  - `npm run test`: 130 (was 129; +1 new).
  - `npm run build`: exit 0.
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` clean tree: ≤ 292 (no production code changes).
  - `npx eslint <changed files>`: zero new errors.
- **Depends on:** 1b + 1b2 (both merged on main).
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 6-ext — Cross-role landing permission contract
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` ([PR #25](https://github.com/ntondow/vettdre/pull/25))
- **Priority:** low (Phase 3 polish)
- **Goal:** Extend slice 6's permission-compat contract from "agent" (role-string identity) to owner / admin / manager via the *pure* User.role → BrokerageRole translation path.
- **Why:** slice 6 was scoped to agent only because that's the one role string that appears in both `User.role` and `BrokerageRoleType` vocabularies. Other roles flow through a translation layer that can drift silently — bms-auth had two near-identical inline `ROLE_MAP` literals (in `getCurrentBrokerageRole` + `getCurrentAgentInfo`) duplicating the manager/admin/owner mapping.
- **Approach (Option A):** Extract the pure subset of the translation into `src/lib/bms-role-translation.ts` (`translateUserRoleToBrokerageRole`), which depends only on the User.role string. Refactor *both* `getCurrentBrokerageRole` and `getCurrentAgentInfo` to call the helper instead of inlining ROLE_MAP. Add 8 new contracts to `tests/smoke/role-landing.test.ts`: 5 pure-helper unit tests + 3 cross-role permission contracts (owner/admin/manager). No behavior change vs the previous inline mappings — verified per-input.
- **Scope notes:** super_admin and agent are documented exclusions in the cross-role loop. super_admin lands on `/dashboard` which is outside `PAGE_PERMISSION_MAP` (parked by 3.Z). agent is already covered by slice 6 via role-string identity. The "first user in org is owner" fallback and the BrokerAgent.brokerageRole DB read remain DB-dependent and out of pure-helper scope (manual end-to-end coverage per phase).
- **Closes:** the gap left by slice 6's source-only scope. Catches drift on the User → BrokerageRole map that slice 6 can't see.
- **Files:** new `src/lib/bms-role-translation.ts`, modified `src/lib/bms-auth.ts`, modified `tests/smoke/role-landing.test.ts`.
- **Depends on:** none blocking (1b + 6 on main).

**[PHASE 2 APPROVAL GATE — STOP HERE]**

---

## Phase 3 — IA + polish (Week 4)

### 7 — Single sidebar per role
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` ([PR #27](https://github.com/ntondow/vettdre/pull/27))
- **Goal:** Brokerage admins → brokerage-shaped sidebar (Wireframe B: WORK / LISTINGS & DEALS / INTEL — three sections, ten items, down from nine sections / thirteen items). Agents → agent-focused sidebar (Wireframe A: WORK / RESEARCH — two sections, nine items, down from three sections / ten items).
- **Closes bug:** addresses U-001 through U-005, U-012.
- **Approach:** Replace `AGENT_NAV_SECTIONS` and `ADMIN_NAV_SECTIONS` constants in `sidebar.tsx` per the approved wireframes. Mirror in `mobile-nav.tsx` (5-tab bottom bar holds highest-frequency surfaces; More sheet holds the rest). Flip the role-branch polarity from `role === "agent" ? AGENT : ADMIN` (privilege-by-default) to `isAdminRole(role) ? ADMIN : AGENT` with a positive-match `ADMIN_USER_ROLES = {admin, owner, super_admin}` set — unknown roles fall through to agent. Add submitted-count badge to the global "Brokerage" item (override-aware via `useSearchParams`'s `?as_org=`). Delete `ComingSoonItem` function + all `comingSoon` code paths (Property Management section gone). Remove AUTOMATION top-level entry (still accessible via `/settings/automations`) and the duplicate "Client Onboarding" global entry (single source of truth in the brokerage sub-nav).
- **Files:** `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`, `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx`, `tests/smoke/sidebar-shape.test.ts` (NEW — 20 source-level contracts: Wireframe A item set, Wireframe B item set, removed surfaces, polarity flip, submitted-count badge wiring, mobile-desktop parity bidirectional).
- **Bundled chore:** CLAUDE.md lint baseline 4520 → 4484 (re-anchored per surface-baseline-mismatches rule; 36-error improvement accumulated across Phase 2 + Phase 3 slices since the 4520 anchor was set).
- **Out of scope:** BrokerageRoleType-based segmentation (manager-aware global sidebar). Today's User.role taxonomy doesn't include "manager" — adding manager-specific global surfaces would require `getCurrentBrokerageRole` from the global layout, a bigger lift. Brokerage sub-nav at `/brokerage/*` still segments by BrokerageRoleType independently. Slice 8 owns the sub-nav flatten; slice 9 owns the emoji → lucide migration.
- **Success criteria:** 20/20 smoke contracts pass. Manual test as each role: agent on /dashboard sees Wireframe A; admin sees Wireframe B; super_admin under override sees admin sidebar with the override-scoped submitted badge. No "Acquisitions / Closing / Portfolio / Property Management" jargon anywhere.
- **Depends on:** Phase 2 (done).

### 8 — Brokerage nav flatten
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` ([PR #28](https://github.com/ntondow/vettdre/pull/28))
- **Goal:** From 7 sections × 17 items (Variant 3 in slice 7's inventory) to 3 sections × 11 items + Admin link (Wireframe C). One above the ≤10 target — ship at 11; both My Deals and Leaderboard have clear weekly use cases for John/Kristin.
- **Closes bug:** U-013, U-014, U-016.
- **Approach:** Replace `ADMIN_NAV` in `brokerage/layout.tsx` per Wireframe C (Operations / Agents & Listings / Reports / Admin). Drop entire stale "Admin > Setup" section from `AGENT_NAV` (agents shouldn't see brokerage_admin onboarding wizard; pre-slice-8 layout returned AGENT_NAV unfiltered). Relocate four sub-nav items: Setup, Commission Plans, Compliance → Settings page "Brokerage Configuration" cards (lighter approach — no inline tab refactor). Bulk Invoices was already accessible via existing "Bulk Generate" button in `/brokerage/invoices` header (no change needed). Add `<ComplianceAlert />` to `/brokerage/dashboard` — calls existing `getExpiringItems(60)` helper (no Prisma schema change), surfaces "X compliance documents expiring in next 60 days. View →" amber callout, override-aware via `?as_org=`. Without this Dashboard alert, hiding Compliance from sub-nav is unsafe — NYS license expiration is a real-world legal risk.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/layout.tsx` (constants flatten + agent cleanup), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/dashboard/page.tsx` (import + render alert), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/dashboard/components/compliance-alert.tsx` (NEW), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/settings/page.tsx` (Brokerage Configuration card section), `tests/smoke/brokerage-subnav-shape.test.ts` (NEW — 21 contracts: Wireframe C item set, removed surfaces, agent variant cleanup, sub-nav badge wiring, mobile pill ordering parity, Compliance Dashboard alert wiring + auto-hide guard + override propagation, Settings cards reachability).
- **Success criteria:** 21/21 smoke contracts pass. Manager nav matches consulting proposal in audit doc.
- **Depends on:** 7 (merged).

### 3.Z — Admin Home for super_admin (slice 1b follow-up)
- **Status:** `pending`
- **Goal:** Replace `/dashboard` as the super_admin landing with a real admin home — tenant switcher, cross-tenant activity feed, team management entry, audit log shortcut.
- **Why:** super_admin currently inherits the investor-shaped `/dashboard` (per slice 1b) which has nothing administratively useful for Vettdre staff. Slice 1b parks them there as an interim; this slice replaces it with a purpose-built surface.
- **Files:** new `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx` + supporting components. Update `landingForRole("super_admin")` in `src/app/page.tsx` to point to the new path.
- **Smoke contract delta:** the slice 1b smoke test pinning `super_admin → /dashboard` will need updating in this slice — flag in the PR description so the reviewer knows the change is intentional, not a regression.
- **Depends on:** Phase 1 + 3 work first; this is platform polish.
- **Requires approval:** YES — new admin surface, wireframe gated.

### 9 — Emoji → lucide icon migration (nav surfaces)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` ([PR #29](https://github.com/ntondow/vettdre/pull/29))
- **Goal:** All nav surfaces use lucide-react icon components instead of emoji characters. NavItem.icon type widens from `string` to `LucideIcon` in three files, converging on the same render-path pattern brokerage/layout.tsx adopted in slice 8.
- **Closes bug:** U-002, U-004 (partial — emoji half).
- **Approach:** 54 emoji-character icons → 54 lucide-react components across `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` (18 NAV + sign-out + collapse arrows = 21 swaps), `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx` (5 tabs + 7 More items + Menu trigger + sign-out = 14 swaps), and `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/settings-sidebar.tsx` (14 NAV + 5 ADMIN_NAV = 19 swaps). NavItem.icon: string → LucideIcon in all three files; render swaps `<span>{item.icon}</span>` → `const Icon = item.icon; <Icon className="..." />`. Three semantic disambiguations baked in and locked by smoke contract: Pipeline → GitBranch (BarChart3 reads "reports", which Reports owns), AI Settings → Sparkles (Bot is reserved for Leasing), Add User → UserPlus (specific intent vs. generic Plus). Mobile Dashboard → LayoutDashboard for desktop parity (no Home/Dashboard semantic split).
- **Files:** `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`, `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx`, `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/settings-sidebar.tsx`, `tests/smoke/sidebar-icon-migration.test.ts` (NEW — 7 source-level contracts in 3 describe blocks: emoji-free regex per file, lucide imports matching swap table, NavItem type widening, semantic disambiguations locked by name).
- **Bundled chore:** CLAUDE.md typecheck baseline 286 → 288 (re-anchored per surface-baseline-mismatches rule; +2 errors accumulated silently on origin/main between PR #28 close and slice 9 measurement — not introduced by slice 9 itself, which holds 288 → 288 across two consecutive runs both pre-edit and post-edit).
- **Out of scope (deferred):**
  - **9-typography (Phase 4):** ALL CAPS section header removal — stylistic change unsanctioned by audit; deferred to keep the nav-icon migration clean and bisectable.
  - **9-ext (after Phase 3 deploy):** ~7 secondary render-side emoji surfaces (contacts/deals/market-intel/leasing/messages). Each uses emoji differently and bundling would inflate a clean nav-migration slice.
  - **9-db-emoji-migration (Phase 4):** `EmailLabel.icon` `DEFAULT_LABELS` and `Pipeline.stages` JSON contain DB-stored emoji strings. Migration requires a Prisma data-shape decision (keep schema as nullable string with lucide-name lookup, vs. migrate stored values, vs. drop the icon column). Out of scope for slice 9.
- **Success criteria:** 7/7 new contracts pass; 41/41 existing slice-7/slice-8 sidebar + brokerage-subnav contracts continue passing; visual nav surfaces render lucide components instead of emoji on agent + admin + super_admin views (manual smoke after deploy).
- **Depends on:** 7 (merged), 8 (merged).
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 10 — Empty states pattern across all surfaces
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Extend slice 18's filter-aware empty-state pattern (filter-narrowed branch with no CTA + slate-zero branch with primary CTA + per-branch testid hooks) from `/brokerage/client-onboarding` to 5 more list surfaces.
- **Closes bug:** U-029, U-071
- **Surfaces migrated (5):**
  - `/brokerage/transactions` (search + typeFilter + stageFilter; multi-axis → "Clear filters to see everything.")
  - `/brokerage/invoices` (statusFilter tabs + search; tab-canonical → "Try the All tab to see everything." Bug fix: pre-slice-10 branched only on `search`, ignoring statusFilter.)
  - `/brokerage/payments` (search + dates + method; multi-axis. Pre-slice-10 already had correct CTA-presence semantics; slice 10 adds testid contracts to lock in the invariants.)
  - `/brokerage/agents` (statusFilter tabs + search; same shape as invoices, same statusFilter bug fixed.)
  - `/contacts` (typeFilter pills; cross-file split — slate-zero in `page.tsx`, filter-narrowed in `contact-list.tsx`. Documented exception: slate-zero has no inline CTA because the page-toolbar `<ContactForm />` is the implicit primary action.)
- **Skipped (per stop condition):** `/deals/pipeline` — kanban shape doesn't translate cleanly to the list-page pattern (with active filters and zero results, user sees empty kanban columns rather than a single empty-state block).
- **Per-surface copy variance:** intentional. Multi-axis surfaces use "Clear filters" (no canonical "All" to revert to); tab-canonical use "Try the All tab"; pill-canonical use "Try the All filter." Forcing one phrasing would either lie about the filter shape or be uselessly generic. Contract is on structural invariants (testid + CTA presence), not exact text.
- **Files:** `transactions/page.tsx`, `invoices/page.tsx`, `payments/page.tsx`, `agents/page.tsx`, `contacts/page.tsx`, `contacts/contact-list.tsx`, `tests/smoke/empty-state-pattern.test.ts` (NEW — 26 contracts: 5 per surface + 1 contacts-split exception, asserting testid presence, no-CTA-on-filtered, CTA-on-zero, copy differs, filter-condition combines all axes).
- **Verification gates:**
  - `npm run test`: 245 pass (was 219; +26 new). Test files: 12 (was 11).
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` filtered: 288 (matches baseline; zero new TS errors). Two consecutive runs.
  - `npm run build`: exit 0.
  - `npx eslint <changed files>`: 40 problems on touched files match origin/main exactly (verified by checkout-from-origin/main rerun). Zero new lint errors.
- **Success criteria:** Each of the 5 migrated surfaces renders correct empty-state copy + correct CTA presence based on filter state; smoke contracts catch any regression that drops a testid, adds a CTA to the filter-narrowed branch, or forgets to consult a filter axis.
- **Depends on:** 18 (merged).
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 19 — Document template management UI
- **Status:** `in_progress` (Phase 1 audit complete 2026-05-01; B1 in flight)
- **Goal:** Settings → Brokerage → Templates tab. Upload custom PDFs + map fields.
- **Closes bug:** U-076, U-084
- **Files:** new — settings templates page + template upload action.
- **Success criteria:** Brokerage admin can upload + map a custom doc. Visible in onboarding form.
- **Depends on:** Phase 2
- **Requires approval:** YES — biggest new feature, scope check.
- **Phase 1 audit outcome (2026-05-01):** Document Vault is **already built but invisible**. List page (`/brokerage/client-onboarding/vault/page.tsx`, 236 lines, upload + delete) and full visual editor (`/vault/[id]/page.tsx`, 341 lines, click-to-place fields) exist with all 5 server actions wired and the schema designed for `category: "standard" | "custom"`. The /new picker already consumes custom templates. Scope re-frames from "build template UI" to "ship + harden the existing UI." Critical bugs in the existing editor: (1) iframe-based PDF preview has the same iOS Safari black hole we fixed in slice 20-fixes-C; (2) page-1-only field filter prevents multi-page editing; (3) no field move/resize after placement; (4) no nav links — discoverable only by direct URL. Approved scope: Option B with 2-PR split. Option C (URL move to settings) deferred until usage patterns emerge.
- **Fix order:** B1 (visibility + iOS pdfjs migration) → B2 (multi-page + drag/resize).

### 20 — Signing flow end-to-end audit + fixes
- **Status:** `done` (audit complete + all 4 fix slices merged/awaiting_review; closeout 2026-05-01)
- **Goal:** Walk /sign/[token] flow. Test mobile, multi-device, resume mid-signing. Fix what breaks.
- **Closes bug:** Various deferred from initial audit
- **Files:** `src/app/sign/[token]/*` + signing components.
- **Success criteria:** Manual + smoke test pass on mobile + desktop.
- **Depends on:** Phase 2
- **Requires approval:** No.
- **Phase 1 audit outcome (2026-05-01):** 24 defects across 9 surfaces. 5 P0s (sign-route signature crash, completion download returns JSON, completed onboardings 410'd as error, false "emailed to you" claim, jsdelivr CDN dependency for PDF preview), 8 P1s (mobile orientation wipes signature, refresh loses field state, double-click race creates duplicate Contact, etc.), 11 P2s. Fix order: A (P0 batch) → B (P1 batch) → C (P1 mobile UX) → D (P2 polish).
- **Closeout (2026-05-01):** 24 defects identified → 22 shipped across 4 fix slices (A=5, B=4, C=3, D=10) → 2 dropped on re-verification (#11 termDays display drift was a dead fallback in the public flow; #23 sequential-signing >= comparison was correctly handling sibling sortOrder cases — both filed as Phase 5 polish stubs where the concern *could* legitimately apply: agent-side display + reminder cron for #11; cross-onboarding sort-order audit for #23). Plus 2 Phase 5 stubs for honest-UX deferrals (`20-fix-followup-client-email` for the false "emailed to you" claim removed in slice A; `20-fix-followup-term-display` for #11). Fix slices: PR #34 (A, merged), PR #35 (B, merged), PR #36 (C, merged), PR #37 (D, awaiting review).

### 20-fixes-A — Signing flow P0 fixes (Gulino-blocking)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Ship the 5 P0 fixes from slice 20's audit in one PR — eliminates 90% of weekend risk for Gulino's first signing clients.
- **Closes bug:** 5 of 24 defects from slice 20 audit (the P0 batch).
- **Defects fixed:**
  1. `sign/route.ts:185` — guard `signatureImage.slice()` against undefined (no-signature templates were 500'ing).
  2. `signing-complete.tsx` + `download` route — render per-doc download links with explicit `?docType=` (the single "Download Your Copies" button hit the no-docType path which returns JSON, not files).
  3. `verify/route.ts` — return 200 (not 410) for `status === "completed"` so client routes to the `already_complete` branch with download UI instead of the red error screen.
  4. `signing-complete.tsx` — remove the false "A copy of all signed documents has been emailed to you" claim. Replaced with honest "Your agent has been notified. They'll be in touch shortly with next steps." (Real client email is filed as Phase 5 follow-up; tonight is honest UX, not new infrastructure.)
  5. `pdf-field-viewer.tsx` — self-host pdfjs worker + cmaps under `public/pdfjs/`. CDN dependency on `cdn.jsdelivr.net` removed; corp networks, CSP, and offline clients can now render the preview.
- **Files:** `src/app/api/onboarding/[token]/{sign,verify}/route.ts`, `src/app/sign/[token]/client.tsx`, `src/components/onboarding/{signing-complete,pdf-field-viewer}.tsx`, `public/pdfjs/{pdf.worker.min.mjs,cmaps/*}`, `tests/smoke/signing-fixes-A.test.ts` (new — 7 contracts, one per defect).
- **Success criteria:** typecheck holds within ±1 of baseline; lint changed-files only — zero new errors; build passes; full vitest suite passes; 5 smoke contracts green.
- **Depends on:** slice 20 Phase 1 audit (this slice).
- **Requires approval:** No (audit pre-approved by Nathan with scope adjustment on defect #4: remove + Phase 5 stub instead of wiring client email tonight).
- **Outcome:** Smoke 7/7 green. Full test 252/252. Build clean. Typecheck post-edit measurement 287 vs tracked anchor 288 — see SLICES note + CLAUDE.md re-anchor (the +1 vs pre-edit measurement of 286 is Finder-dupe pollution in `src/lib/condo-ingest/building-signals.test.ts`, not from changed files; my changes net -1 by removing TS18048 'signatureImage is possibly undefined'). Merged as PR #34, commit `f05170a`.

### 20-fixes-B — Signing flow P1 fixes (reliability + mobile UX)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Ship 4 of 5 P1 fixes from slice 20's audit (#11 dropped to Phase 5 — see `20-fix-followup-term-display`). Logic-only, no schema migrations. Targets the real reliability gaps that would surface as Gulino's volume grows: mobile UX failures, accidental input loss, double-submit races, and silent PDF generation failures.
- **Closes bug:** 4 of 24 defects from slice 20 audit (the P1 batch minus #11).
- **Defects fixed:**
  - **#6 Signature snapshot/restore on resize.** `signature-pad.tsx` resize handler now snapshots `pad.toDataURL()` before clear and `fromDataURL()` after — orientation rotation no longer wipes in-progress signatures.
  - **#7 sessionStorage draft persistence.** `client.tsx` persists non-prefill `fieldValues` to sessionStorage keyed `vettdre:signing-draft:${token}:${docId}`. Read on doc mount (with `typeof window` SSR guard); debounced write (300ms) on every fieldValues change; clear on successful sign. Corrupt drafts self-heal via `sessionStorage.removeItem` inside the JSON.parse catch — otherwise they'd re-poison every refresh forever.
  - **#10 Idempotent sign via two-level CAS.** `sign/route.ts` now uses (1) document-level `updateMany({ where: { id, status: { not: "signed" } }})` so the second concurrent transaction's count is 0 and bails with kind: "already_signed" (clean 409 to client); (2) onboarding-completion atomic CAS `updateMany({ where: { id, allDocsSigned: false }})` so only the transaction whose count === 1 "wins the race" and is allowed to fire `runPostCompletionWorkflow`. The `wonRace` boolean prevents the duplicate-Contact race when a client double-clicks Sign on the last doc. Existing fields only — no schema migration. Fire-and-forget pattern preserved (`.catch`, never `await`) with explicit comment so future readers don't accidentally await.
  - **#12 Fail-fast on PDF upload error.** `sign/route.ts` PDF processing block now tracks an explicit `pdfProcessingFailed` boolean (template download, embed, audit footer, or storage upload). On failure, returns 503 BEFORE the database transaction so no document state mutates — client retry lands cleanly. Replaces the pre-fix swallowed catch that was marking docs "signed" while pointing pdfUrl at the unsigned template.
- **Defect dropped:** #11 termDays display drift. Re-verified during proposal: verify route always returns `effectiveThrough` (absolute date) when `termDays` is set, and client.tsx welcome panel uses `effectiveThrough || ${termDays} days` — the fallback is dead in practice because both derive from the same `expiresAt`. UI shows the correct absolute date. Filed as Phase 5 polish stub `20-fix-followup-term-display` to audit the *agent-side* display + reminder cron where stale term math could matter.
- **Files:** `src/app/api/onboarding/[token]/sign/route.ts`, `src/app/sign/[token]/client.tsx`, `src/components/onboarding/signature-pad.tsx`, `tests/smoke/signing-fixes-B.test.ts` (new — 7 contracts), `CLAUDE.md` (re-anchor 288 → 285), `SLICES.md` (this entry + Phase 5 stub).
- **Success criteria:** typecheck holds at 285 (clean tree); lint changed-files only — zero new errors; build passes; full vitest suite passes; 7 smoke contracts green.
- **Depends on:** 20-fixes-A (merged, PR #34).
- **Requires approval:** No (proposal pre-approved by Nathan with two notes incorporated: corrupt-draft self-heal in #7, fire-and-forget comment in #10).
- **Outcome:** Smoke 7/7 green. Full test 259/259. Build clean. Typecheck dirty-tree 287 vs clean-tree 285 (the +2 is Finder-dupe pollution in `src/lib/condo-ingest/building-signals.test.ts`, not from changed files; my changes net 0 new errors in changed files). Merged as PR #35, commit `49dcdb4`.

### 20-fixes-C — Signing flow P1 mobile UX fixes
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Ship 3 P1 mobile UX fixes from slice 20's audit. Single PR; no schema migrations. Targets the cluster of mobile-specific failures that smoke tests can pin architecturally but only Gulino's manual phone test can verify visually post-deploy: the two-button signature confusion, the iOS Safari iframe-PDF black hole, and the sub-44px touch targets.
- **Closes bug:** 3 of 24 defects from slice 20 audit (the P1 mobile UX cluster).
- **Defects fixed:**
  - **#8 Auto-emit signature, drop Confirm button.** `signature-pad.tsx` now auto-emits via `pad.addEventListener("endStroke", debouncedEmit)` (200ms debounce after the user stops drawing) for drawn mode, and via `onBlur` + 500ms-debounced `useEffect` for typed mode. The "Confirm Signature" button and `handleConfirm` callback are gone — the parent's "Sign & Continue" is now the single primary CTA, eliminating the two-button confusion. An `aria-live="polite"` region announces "Signature captured" for screen reader users (replacing the dynamic feedback the dropped button used to provide). Uses `onSignatureRef` pattern so the parent's prop changes don't thrash the canvas init useEffect.
  - **#9 iframe → pdfjs render in pdf-viewer.tsx.** Legacy (non-template) PDF preview now renders via the same self-hosted `/pdfjs/` worker path that pdf-field-viewer.tsx uses — proven to work on iOS Safari for templates (the common case in production today). The `<iframe src="...pdf">` is gone, eliminating the iOS bug where the iframe would silently fail to render but still fire `onLoad` → IntersectionObserver-based "Reviewed" badge would mark the doc reviewed when nothing was visible. Reviewed badge UX, IntersectionObserver pattern (3s view delay), and "Open PDF in New Tab" error fallback all preserved.
  - **#13 44px hit area for interactive fields.** `pdf-field-viewer.tsx` field overlay `minHeight`/`minWidth` is now conditional: 44px for interactive (non-prefill) fields per iOS HIG, 16px for prefill (locked) fields because they're never tapped. Bumping prefill too would cause overlap on dense forms (DOS-1736 has 8 fields close together). Interactive fields are typically 1-3 signatures + 1-2 dates spaced apart, so 44px doesn't materially overlap.
- **Files:** `src/components/onboarding/signature-pad.tsx`, `src/components/onboarding/pdf-viewer.tsx`, `src/components/onboarding/pdf-field-viewer.tsx`, `tests/smoke/signing-fixes-C.test.ts` (new — 7 contracts), `SLICES.md` (this entry).
- **Success criteria:** typecheck holds at clean-tree 285; lint changed-files only — zero new errors; build passes; full vitest suite passes; 7 smoke contracts green. Mobile runtime verification is Nathan's manual phone test post-deploy (smoke contracts pin architecture, not visual outcome — see PR body for the 7-step checklist).
- **Depends on:** 20-fixes-B (merged, PR #35) — both touch signature-pad.tsx; needed B's resize-snapshot work as the foundation before this slice's auto-emit.
- **Requires approval:** No (proposal pre-approved by Nathan with all three options confirmed: Option A auto-emit for #8, single PR with mid-flight split condition for #9, interactive-only 44px for #13).
- **Outcome:** Smoke 7/7 green. Full test 266/266. Build clean. Typecheck dirty-tree 287 vs clean-tree 285 (the +2 is the same Finder-dupe pollution we've seen since slice 20-fixes-A; not from changed files — verified zero new tsc errors in signature-pad.tsx, pdf-viewer.tsx, pdf-field-viewer.tsx). 0 new lint errors on changed files. The pdf-viewer.tsx rewrite added one `<img>` warning that matches pdf-field-viewer.tsx's existing pattern (pdfjs renders to a canvas dataURL, which Next/Image's optimizer can't handle — plain `<img>` is correct). pdf-viewer.tsx grew 124 → 195 lines (+71, under the 100-line stop condition for #9). Total slice diff ~140 code + ~210 tests = ~350 lines, slightly over the 280 target but within the 320 mid-flight stop threshold; held as one PR rather than splitting per the precommitted call.

### 20-fixes-D — Signing flow P2 polish (closes slice 20 audit)
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Ship 10 of 11 P2 polish fixes from slice 20's audit in a single PR — the final pass that closes the slice 20 audit. Logic-only, no schema migrations.
- **Closes bug:** 10 of 24 defects from slice 20 audit (the P2 batch minus #23).
- **Defects fixed:**
  - **#14 Fire-and-forget expired-cache update.** Both `verify/route.ts` and `sign/route.ts` now use `prisma...update().catch(...)` (no await) for the `status: "expired"` flip. Source of truth is `expiresAt < now()`; the cached status is just a denormalized hint for agent-side queries and doesn't gate any read logic, so blocking the GET on this write was wasted latency.
  - **#15 Cap audit-log fieldValues at 500 chars + filter images.** `sign/route.ts` audit log metadata now filters out values starting with `data:image` (signature blobs were ~50KB each in the JSON column) and truncates remaining text values at 500 chars with an ellipsis suffix. Bounds JSON growth without losing the audit signal.
  - **#16 410 (not 404) for token-not-found.** `verify/route.ts` returns 410 with a generic "no longer valid" message when the token isn't found, matching the voided/expired shape. Removes the enumeration vector that pre-fix let attackers distinguish "valid token, voided" (410) from "invalid token" (404).
  - **#17 Server-derived signer identity.** `sign/route.ts` no longer reads `signerName`/`signerEmail` from the request body — they're derived from the canonical onboarding record post-lookup (`${firstName} ${lastName}` + `clientEmail`). The body fields are still allowed in the type for client back-compat (no-op migration) but ignored at read time. A malicious request can't record a different name on the audit log.
  - **#18 Midpoint progress math.** `client.tsx` progress bar now uses `(docIndex + 0.5) / totalDocs` so the bar moves halfway through the current doc, not just on doc flip. Makes mid-flow progress visible for multi-doc onboardings.
  - **#19 Clear focusedFieldId on doc switch.** `client.tsx` advance branch (after successful sign on a non-final doc) now calls `setFocusedFieldId(null)` alongside the other per-doc resets. Without this, the field-overlay highlight from the previous doc carried into the next one.
  - **#20 Per-page render progress.** Both `pdf-field-viewer.tsx` and `pdf-viewer.tsx` now track `{ current, total }` page-render progress and surface it in the loading UI as "Loading page X of N..." instead of a static "Loading...". Slow-mobile users see motion. Both viewers are near-twins post-slice-C, so the same pattern applies to both for consistency.
  - **#21 Retry button on PDF render error.** Both `pdf-field-viewer.tsx` and `pdf-viewer.tsx` error states now render a Retry button wired to re-invoke the `renderPdf()` callback. A transient network blip no longer strands the user (pre-fix they'd have to manually reload the whole page).
  - **#22 signedPath keys by doc.id, not docType.** `sign/route.ts` storage upload path is now `onboarding/${onboarding.id}/signed/${doc.id}.pdf` instead of using `doc.docType`. Two documents with the same custom docType in one onboarding (possible for templates with custom types) no longer collide on `upsert: true`. Pre-existing pdfUrl values keep working — they're stored per-document.
  - **#24 Server-side date override at sign time.** `sign/route.ts` walks template fields BEFORE `embedFieldValues` and overwrites any field with `prefillKey === "date"` with the server's `signDate`. The embedded PDF is the legal artifact — a long-open tab no longer embeds the stale client-side date from when the user first opened the link.
- **Defect dropped:** #23 sequential-signing >= comparison. Re-verified during proposal: the loop `for (const prev of onboarding.documents) { if (prev.sortOrder >= doc.sortOrder) break; ... }` correctly stops at the current doc and only enforces "all earlier docs signed" semantics. Sibling docs (same sortOrder — possible if two templates share an order) are intentionally treated as concurrent, not sequential. Behavior is correct. Filed as Phase 5 polish stub `20-fix-followup-sortorder-audit` to audit cross-onboarding behavior where sortOrder collisions might confuse the agent UI.
- **Files:** `src/app/api/onboarding/[token]/{sign,verify}/route.ts`, `src/app/sign/[token]/client.tsx`, `src/components/onboarding/{pdf-field-viewer,pdf-viewer}.tsx`, `tests/smoke/signing-fixes-D.test.ts` (new — 13 contracts, one+ per defect), `SLICES.md` (this entry + slice 20 closeout).
- **Success criteria:** typecheck holds at clean-tree 285 (= dirty-tree 287); lint changed-files only — zero new errors; build passes; full vitest suite passes; 13 smoke contracts green.
- **Depends on:** 20-fixes-C (merged, PR #36).
- **Requires approval:** No (proposal pre-approved by Nathan: drop #23, silent-ignore for #17, apply #20+#21 to both viewers, slice 20 closing summary in PR body).
- **Outcome:** Smoke 13/13 green. Full test 279/279. Build clean. Typecheck dirty-tree 287 = clean-tree 285 (anchor held exactly; the +2 dirty-tree delta is the same Finder-dupe pollution we've seen since slice 20-fixes-A, not from changed files — verified zero new tsc errors in the 5 changed files). 0 new lint errors on changed files (4 pre-existing warnings: 3 `<img>` for canvas-rendered PDFs which is intentional, 1 useCallback dep warning that predates this slice). Total slice diff ~70 code + ~270 tests = ~340 lines, slightly over the 320 mid-flight threshold but the smoke test file is most of it (13 contracts × ~20 lines each); held as one PR per the precommitted single-PR-for-slice-20-closeout call.

### 19-B1 — Vault visibility + iOS pdfjs migration
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Surface the existing Document Vault into the brokerage subnav AND replace its iframe-based PDF preview with the same self-hosted pdfjs render path the public viewers use. After this ships, brokerage admins can find the vault and the editor works on iPad/iPhone for single-page templates. Multi-page editing + drag/resize is 19-B2.
- **Closes bug:** 4 of the slice 19 audit's "vault visibility + iOS bug" cluster.
- **Defects fixed:**
  - **Visibility (3 surfaces wired):** New `Documents` group in `brokerage/layout.tsx` ADMIN_NAV with a `Templates` item linking to `/brokerage/client-onboarding/vault`. Inline "Manage templates" affordance on `/new` picker next to the selected-count span — admins discover the vault while picking templates.
  - **canAccessPage gate added.** `bms-permissions.ts` PAGE_PERMISSION_MAP is whitelist-based (returns false for unmapped paths); without the explicit add the new subnav entry would silently disappear. Vault gated on a new `manage_templates` permission scoped to admin-tier (`brokerage_admin`, `broker`, `manager`) — matches the pattern of `view_agents`, `view_dashboard`, `transactions_manage`. Agents can still see templates via the /new picker (read-only consumption) but can't manage them.
  - **iOS pdfjs migration in editor.** `vault/[id]/page.tsx` replaces the iframe (lines 216-221 pre-fix) with the same `pdfjs-dist` render path used by `pdf-field-viewer.tsx` (slice 20-fixes-A) and `pdf-viewer.tsx` (slice 20-fixes-C). Self-hosted worker + cmaps (no jsdelivr CDN). Per-page render progress + Retry button on error (slice 20-fixes-D parity).
- **Defect intentionally deferred to B2:** Multi-page editing — `vault/[id]/page.tsx:223` still filters `fields.filter((f) => f.page === 0)`, so even though pdfjs renders all pages, only the first page is editable. Hardcoded 612×792 canvas size is also B2 (will become per-page dynamic via pdfjs viewport). Single-page templates work end-to-end on iOS post-B1; that's the customer value here.
- **Pre-existing bugs surfaced as Phase 5 stubs:**
  - `19-fix-followup-doctype-enum` — `actions.ts:353` hardcodes `docType: "tenant_rep_agreement"` for ALL custom templates because `OnboardingDocTypeValue` is a 3-value enum.
  - `19-fix-followup-vault-rbac` — vault-actions server actions (createDocumentTemplate, deleteDocumentTemplate, updateTemplateFields) check `orgId` but NOT role. Direct-URL access to `/vault` bypasses the subnav RBAC gate. Pre-existing; not introduced by B1.
  - `19-fix-followup-ia-cleanup` — revisit `/vault` URL location after B1 + B2 ship and we know how Gulino actually uses it.
  - `19-fix-followup-doc-references` — CLAUDE.md and SLICES.md don't yet reference the existing vault implementation. Doc-cleanup pass.
- **Files:** `src/lib/bms-types.ts` (+1 permission), `src/lib/bms-permissions.ts` (+1 PAGE_PERMISSION_MAP entry), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/layout.tsx` (Documents group + Layers icon), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/vault/[id]/page.tsx` (iframe → pdfjs render path), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/new/page.tsx` (inline Manage templates link), `tests/smoke/vault-visibility-ios.test.ts` (new — 7 contracts), `SLICES.md` (this entry + 19-B2 stub + 4 Phase 5 stubs).
- **Success criteria:** typecheck holds at clean-tree 285 (= dirty-tree 287); lint changed-files only — zero new errors; build passes; full vitest suite passes; 7 smoke contracts green.
- **Depends on:** slice 19 Phase 1 audit (this slice).
- **Requires approval:** No (proposal pre-approved by Nathan with all 3 questions answered: new Documents group, brokerage subnav only — not global rail or mobile More sheet, inline link placement on /new picker).
- **Outcome:** _filled in at gate-run time_

### 19-B2a — Vault editor multi-page navigation + variable canvas + page selector
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Make the vault editor work for multi-page templates. Today the editor renders only page 1 even when pdfjs renders all pages. After B2a, John can upload a 5-page landlord agreement and place fields on every page via tab navigation; misplaced fields are recoverable via a Page selector in the field editor sidebar (no delete + re-place required).
- **Closes bug:** 3 of the slice 19 audit's "production-grade editor" cluster (defects 1, 5, 6 from the B2 plan).
- **Defects fixed:**
  - **Defect 1 — Multi-page navigation.** New `currentPage` state (default 0). Page tab strip rendered above the canvas, hidden on single-page templates (`pages.length > 1` gate) so single-page editing is unchanged. The displayed image switches from `pages[0]` to `pages[currentPage]`. Field overlay filter switches from `f.page === 0` to `f.page === currentPage`. New-field placement (`handlePdfClick` + `addField`) writes `page: currentPage` so a field placed while looking at page 2 lands on page 2.
  - **Defect 5 — Variable per-page canvas size.** Drop the hardcoded `width: 612px, minHeight: 792px`. Container size now derives from `pages[currentPage].width / 2` and `.height / 2` (pdfjs renders at 2x for retina; display at half). Falls back to legacy 612×792 only during initial load before pages render. Aligns legal/A4/landscape PDFs correctly. Field overlay percentages remain relative to the new container size, so existing field positions stay correct.
  - **Defect 6 — Page selector in field editor sidebar.** New `<select>` in the field editor block alongside Type/Prefill, bound to `selectedField.page`. Lets users reassign a field to a different page without delete + re-place. Hidden on single-page templates to avoid a no-op control.
- **Cross-page drag intentionally NOT supported.** Filed as Phase 5 stub `19-fix-followup-cross-page-move`. Rationale: the editor shows one page at a time, so there's no destination canvas to catch a cross-page drop. The Page selector in the field editor (defect 6) gives users a manual recovery path that's enough for B2a's scope.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/vault/[id]/page.tsx` (state + tabs + render swap + filter swap + variable canvas + Page selector), `tests/smoke/vault-editor-multipage.test.ts` (new — 7 contracts), `SLICES.md` (this entry + B2b stub + cross-page-move stub).
- **Success criteria:** typecheck holds at clean-tree 285 (= dirty-tree 287); lint changed-files only — zero new errors; build passes; full vitest suite passes; 7 smoke contracts green.
- **Depends on:** 19-B1 (merged, PR #38).
- **Requires approval:** No (proposal pre-approved by Nathan: all 6 recommendations accepted including pre-commit B2a/B2b split for bisect-clarity).
- **Outcome:** _filled in at gate-run time_

### 19-B2b — Vault editor field drag-to-move + corner resize + touch
- **Status:** `awaiting_review`
- **Goal:** Add interactive field manipulation on rendered overlays. Drag a placed field with mouse or finger to move it; drag corner handles to resize. Boundary-clamp at page edges so fields stay on the page. Touch-event parity on iPad via Pointer Events API. After B2b, the editor is production-grade: misplacement is recoverable via drag (alongside the Page selector from B2a).
- **Closes bug:** 3 of the slice 19 audit's "production-grade editor" cluster (defects 2, 3, 4 from the B2 plan).
- **Defects fixed:**
  - **Defect 2 — Field drag-to-move via Pointer Events.** `onPointerDown` on the field overlay calls `setPointerCapture()` (load-bearing — keeps events flowing to the field even when the cursor leaves), records pointer + field origin in `dragState`. `onPointerMove` computes percentage delta from `pdfContainerRef`'s rect and clamps with `Math.min(..., 100 - field.width)` / `Math.min(..., 100 - field.height)`. Page-agnostic by construction (percentages, not pixel coordinates). `onPointerUp` clears state. `updateField` routes through `setFields` so the change survives re-renders.
  - **Defect 3 — 4-corner resize handles.** When `selectedFieldId === field.id`, render 4 absolutely-positioned 12px corner squares (nw/ne/sw/se) offset by -6px to straddle the field corners. Each handle has its own `onPointerDown` that `stopPropagation`s (so the field's drag handler doesn't also fire) and sets `resizeState` with the corner identifier. The move handler runs per-corner math: each corner anchors the OPPOSITE corner during resize (nw drag pins se, etc.). Min-size enforcement with anchor-opposite-corner logic so a deliberately-shrunk field stops at MIN size with the anchored corner fixed. Page-bound clamps (newX < 0, newX + newW > 100, etc.) prevent off-page resize.
  - **Defect 4 — Touch-event compatibility for iPad.** `touch-action: "none"` inline style on the field overlay AND on each resize handle. Without it, iOS Safari intercepts touch sequences as native scroll/pinch and our Pointer Events never fire. Canvas itself stays touch-action: auto so pinch-zoom between fields still works (admins might want to inspect placement on an A4 PDF).
- **Min field size:** 3% × 2% percentages (`MIN_FIELD_WIDTH = 3`, `MIN_FIELD_HEIGHT = 2`). Renders as ≈18 × 16px on US Letter — small enough for tight forms (DOS-1736 has 8 fields close together) but big enough that a deliberately-shrunk field stays visible. Pixel-tap-target concerns evaporate because handles always render on the selected field.
- **Pointer-Events-only convention enforced via smoke contract.** A negative regex pin asserts `onMouseDown=` does NOT appear anywhere in the file. Future copy-paste from Stack Overflow can't silently introduce a parallel mouse-only handler that breaks iPad. (Comments referring to mouse events historically don't match because they lack the `={` JSX prop shape.)
- **Filed as Phase 5 stub:** `19-fix-followup-keyboard-nudge` — arrow-key precision moves for selected fields. Deferred to keep B2b focused on pointer-driven manipulation.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/vault/[id]/page.tsx` (drag/resize state + 6 handlers + 4 corner handle JSX + 2 constants + ResizeCorner type + touch-action wiring), `tests/smoke/vault-editor-drag-resize.test.ts` (new — 8 contracts), `SLICES.md` (this entry + keyboard-nudge Phase 5 stub).
- **Success criteria:** typecheck holds at clean-tree 285 (= dirty-tree 287); lint changed-files only — zero new errors; build passes; full vitest suite passes; 8 smoke contracts green; manual iPad QA verifies drag/resize/touch-action.
- **Depends on:** 19-B2a (merged, commit `c70f2d2`).
- **Requires approval:** No (proposal pre-approved by Nathan with three refinements: bump MIN to 3%×2%, keep contracts separate, file keyboard-nudge stub).
- **Outcome:** _filled in at gate-run time_

### 3.Y — Structural fix for override-context propagation
- **Status:** `pending`
- **Goal:** Replace per-callsite override threading with a single OrgContext wrapper that every Prisma query must use. Make it impossible to forget threading without a typecheck error.
- **Why:** 0c covered ~50 action exports + threading; 0c2 found another ~22 server actions + 12 read-side pages that 0c missed. Pattern will keep recurring as new code is added. Architectural fix collapses this into one place.
- **Approach (agent proposes details when slice begins):**
  - QueryClient wrapper takes OrgContext at construction.
  - Lint rule or TypeScript constraint blocking direct `prisma.*` calls from `app/(dashboard)/brokerage/*` — must go through OrgContext.
  - Migration plan: progressive — new code uses the wrapper; existing code migrates slice-by-slice as it gets touched.
- **Files:** `lib/prisma.ts`, `lib/team-context.ts`, all of `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/**`.
- **Success criteria:** `tests/smoke/override-scoping.test.ts` becomes obsolete because the type system enforces it.
- **Depends on:** Phase 1, 2 (don't refactor while major surfaces are in flux).
- **Requires approval:** YES — architectural change.

### 3.X — Parent branch cleanup
- **Status:** `done` (PR-A merged 2026-04-30; PR-D merged 2026-04-30).
- **Goal (closed):** Merge `feat/super-admin-cross-tenant-view` + 15 BMS overhaul slice branches to main.
- **Plan revision (2026-04-30):** Original A → B → C plan replaced after P0 — deploying from main rolled back all 15 slice branches because they weren't on main yet. Final plan was PR-A + PR-D (single integration PR collapsing planned PR-B + PR-C + the 15 slice branches via rebase of `cf6e1cf` onto main). c05e952 R6 cleanup handled inline in PR-D's rebase.
- **PRs:** PR-A #17 (merged); PR-D (merged 2026-04-30, restoring all 15 BMS overhaul slices to main).
- **Outcome:** main reflects production reality; deploy from main = current prod; no orphan slice branches. Status flipped to `done` in Phase 3 slice 1 (PR #24).

### 13-cross-cut — Manager-side profile-completeness warning at filing time
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` ([PR #26](https://github.com/ntondow/vettdre/pull/26))
- **Priority:** low (Phase 3 polish)
- **Goal:** When a manager uses the slice 7a agent picker on `/brokerage/client-onboarding/new` to file an onboarding for an agent whose profile is incomplete (Full Name, Phone, or License Number missing), surface a warning at the moment of filing — not just on the agent's own /my-deals banner.
- **Why:** Without this, John/Kristin file docs for Anthony, the prefill renders with `(Agent's name)` placeholders, and nobody catches it until the client signs a document with the placeholder visible. Slice 13 surfaces the gap to the agent themselves but doesn't warn the manager filing on their behalf.
- **Approach:** Extend `getAgentRosterForOnboarding` to JOIN BrokerAgent → User and select `user.fullName / user.phone / user.licenseNumber` (no Prisma schema change — fields already on User). Render an inline amber callout in `new/page.tsx` below the picker's helper text via a new `ProfileCompletenessWarning` component that reuses slice 13's `computeMissingProfileFields` helper. Three early-return guards (no selected agent, BrokerAgent.userId === null, or empty missingFields) keep it from firing during initial paint or for pending/invited hires. Copy branches on `isSelf`: second-person ("your profile is missing … Complete your profile") when manager picks themselves, third-person ("{firstName}'s profile … Ask {firstName}") otherwise. Both link to /settings/profile (same target as slice 13's banner).
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/actions.ts` (extend select), `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/new/page.tsx` (warning component + render below picker), `tests/smoke/profile-completion-banner.test.ts` (extend with 8 cross-cut contracts).
- **Success criteria:** when the picker selects an agent with missing fields, an inline note appears below the picker listing the gaps; submission still proceeds (warning not block).
- **Bundled:** CLAUDE.md typecheck baseline 292 → 286 (re-anchored per surface-baseline-mismatches rule).
- **Depends on:** 7a + 13 (both merged).

### 3.W — Clean Finder-duplicate files from main
- **Status:** `awaiting_review` (PR #24 — bundled with 3.X status flip as Phase 3 slice 1).
- **Priority:** low (Phase 3 polish).
- **Goal:** Remove four ` 2.tsx` Finder-duplicate files that landed on main via commit `53d7751 chore: in-flight work — terminal realtime, screening IDV, market-intel updates, building-intel docs`. Surfaced during PR-D rebase (predate PR-D).
- **Files removed (4):**
  - `src/components/layout/sidebar 2.tsx` (375 lines, primary `sidebar.tsx` is 384 lines).
  - `src/app/screen/[token]/client 2.tsx` (376 lines, primary `client.tsx` is 498 lines).
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/screening/[id]/page 2.tsx` (799 lines, primary `page.tsx` is 1021 lines).
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/page 2.tsx` (294 lines, primary `page.tsx` is 499 lines).
- **Verification before removal:** zero imports of any dupe anywhere in `src/` or `tests/`. All dupes are shorter than their primaries (stale snapshots, not divergent forks). Origin commit `53d7751` matches the slice spec exactly.
- **Baseline impact:** typecheck and lint anchors held at 292 / 4520 after removal — the 4 dupes were error-clean themselves, so anchor counts didn't move. CLAUDE.md anchors unchanged.
- **Outcome:** `git ls-files | grep -E ' [0-9]+\.(tsx?|js)$'` returns zero results.

**[PHASE 3 APPROVAL GATE — STOP HERE]**

## After Phase 3

The post-launch hygiene queue from `docs/handoff/bms-audit-2026-04-28.md` (Prisma
schema drift, last_login_at, magic-link guard, transactions.stage, co-broker invoice
path, TypeScript strict mode, ESLint baseline cleanup, etc.) becomes the next sprint
of slices. Add as `Phase 4 — Hygiene` when Phase 3 ships.

The future-features list (Cmd-K, in-app messaging, scheduled reports, mobile-optimized
agent flow, bulk approve) becomes `Phase 5 — Q3 features`. Don't start until product
direction is clear.

---

## Phase 5 — Polish backlog

Low-priority cleanup slices filed during Phase 4 but explicitly deferred to
keep individual slices reviewable. Pick up only if Gulino flags a specific
inconsistency, or batch into a single sweep when capacity permits.

### 9-ext-inline — Inline button-text emoji migration (deferred from 9-ext)
- **Status:** `pending` (Phase 5 polish)
- **Goal:** Migrate emoji embedded directly inside button labels, header text, and inline link prefixes — the cases slice 9-ext deliberately deferred because each needs a per-instance design decision about layout/spacing rather than a typed-props swap.
- **Why deferred from slice 9-ext:** typed-props icons (e.g. `icon: LucideIcon` on a config array) migrate mechanically with no visual change beyond the icon glyph. Inline emoji like `<button>✉️ Email</button>` change layout because lucide components are SVG with explicit width/height — replacing the emoji with `<Mail className="w-4 h-4" /> Email` shifts spacing, baseline alignment, and gap requirements. Shipping inline migrations alongside typed-props would inflate the diff and bury the "easy" structural changes inside per-instance design judgments.
- **Files in scope** (audit-confirmed during slice 9-ext, all surfaces touched but not migrated):
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/contacts/[id]/contact-detail.tsx` — 7 emoji (4 contact info icons, ternary in activity row, empty states)
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/contacts/[id]/contact-dossier.tsx` — ~25 inline uses (button labels for ✉️ Email / 📞 Log Call / 💬 Log Text / 📱 SMS / ✅ Add Task; section headers for ✅ Open Tasks / 💰 Deals / 🏠 Recent Showings / 📈 Stats / 📝 Add a Note / 👥 People at; LinkedIn/Website link prefixes 🔗 / 🌐; activityIcons fallback `|| "📋"` in two render sites; empty states 💰 ✅ 📬; pin indicators 📌; sentiment 🔥/⚡; mailto/tel emoji prefixes ✉️ / 📞)
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/market-intel/building-profile-modal.tsx` — 3 inline (📞 phone, 📞 Call Owner, 💬 SMS)
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/market-intel/nj-building-profile.tsx` and `nys-building-profile.tsx` — 3 emoji each in `<span className="text-lg">` headers (👤 🏠 💰 / 👤 🏢 💰) — adjacent to migrated Section icon prop, so design decision is whether to drop the emoji entirely or replace with lucide
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/messages/messages-view.tsx` — ~10 inline (📬 / 📭 empty states, 📌 pin indicators, sentiment 🔥/⚡, 📎 attachment indicator, sub-headers 👤 / 💰 / 📋 / ✅)
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/contacts/contact-list.tsx` — 2 inline `<span className="text-lg">📞</span>` and `<span className="text-lg">✉️</span>` in row action cells
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/contacts/page.tsx` — 1 emoji (👥) in slate-zero empty state
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/leasing/loading.tsx` — 5 string-emoji uses on `SkeletonSection` (💬 ⏰ 📊 ⚡ ⚙️) — slice 9-ext widened the `SkeletonSection.icon` prop type to `string | LucideIcon` so this caller keeps working unchanged; migration here just swaps the strings to lucide components.
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/deals/pipeline/page.tsx` — 2 inline (🧮 empty state at line 502, ✎ on a non-emoji char that's actually a typographic mark — verify before scope)
- **Approach:** per-file decision. For each inline use:
  - Button text: `<button>X foo</button>` → `<button><Icon className="w-4 h-4" /> foo</button>` plus gap-1.5 to button className.
  - Header text: `<h3>X foo</h3>` → either `<h3><Icon className="w-4 h-4 inline mr-1.5" /> foo</h3>` OR drop the icon (audit each per surface).
  - Link prefix: `<a>X link</a>` → similar to button.
  - Empty-state hero: `<div className="text-3xl">X</div>` → `<Icon className="w-8 h-8 text-slate-300" />` plus container adjustment.
- **Estimated diff:** ~150-200 lines code + 1-2 smoke contracts per file (extend existing sidebar-icon-migration.test.ts file-wide bans now that typed-props are clean).
- **Stop conditions:** any emoji that's load-bearing in user-visible content (not decorative) — surface and skip; any DB-stored emoji (none currently in scope per slice 9-ext-audit, but re-verify before migration).
- **Depends on:** 9-ext (merged).
- **Requires approval:** No, but propose-then-implement per-file given the layout-shift risk.

### 20-fix-followup-term-display — Audit agent-side term display + reminder cron for stale math
- **Status:** `pending` (Phase 5 polish — only ship if Gulino flags drift)
- **Goal:** Audit *agent-side* surfaces (`/brokerage/client-onboarding/*`) and the reminder cron (`onboarding-notifications.ts` + caller) for places that compute or display "X days remaining" from `(expiresAt - createdAt)` instead of `(expiresAt - now)`, which would show the original term length instead of remaining time.
- **Why deferred from slice 20-fixes-B:** Slice 20's audit flagged termDays as a potential drift bug. On re-verification of the *public signing UI* (the slice 20-fixes-B scope), the verify route always returns both `effectiveThrough` (absolute date) and `termDays` (original term length) derived from the same `expiresAt`. The client.tsx welcome panel uses `effectiveThrough || ${termDays} days` — and since `effectiveThrough` is always set when `termDays` is, the fallback is dead in practice. The user sees the correct absolute date "Effective Through April 19, 2026". So the public flow is fine. But the audit's concern could legitimately apply to surfaces outside that scope: the agent dashboard onboarding list might show "expires in 14 days" for an onboarding created 13 days ago; the reminder cron's `daysRemaining` parameter is computed by the caller, not by the verify route, and might reuse stale math.
- **Approach (when picked up):**
  - Grep agent-side surfaces (`src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/**`) for `termDays`, `daysRemaining`, `expiresAt`, `createdAt` computations involving subtraction.
  - Trace the reminder cron caller back from `sendOnboardingReminder` / `sendOnboardingReminderSms` (both accept `daysRemaining` as a parameter) to where the value is computed.
  - Fix any computation that anchors to `createdAt` instead of `now` for "remaining" semantics; preserve `(expiresAt - createdAt)` only where "original term length" is the intended display.
- **Files:** TBD — depends on what the grep finds. Likely `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/page.tsx` + actions, plus the reminder cron entry point (need to locate during the slice).
- **Estimated diff:** ~20-50 lines + 2-3 smoke contracts.
- **Stop conditions:** if no actual drift is found anywhere, close as `done — verified, no fix needed` (same shape as slice 7a-fixup). If drift is found in the reminder cron, surface and confirm before fixing — reminder math affects external client-facing communications.
- **Depends on:** none. Independent slice.
- **Requires approval:** No.

### 20-fix-followup-client-email — Wire client-facing completion email
- **Status:** `pending` (Phase 5 polish — only ship if Gulino asks)
- **Goal:** Send the signing client a transactional email after they complete signing, with secure download links to each signed PDF (the per-doc `?docType=` URLs already exposed).
- **Why deferred from slice 20-fixes-A:** Slice 20-fixes-A removed the false claim "A copy of all signed documents has been emailed to you" from the completion screen and replaced it with honest copy ("Your agent has been notified. They'll be in touch shortly with next steps."). Wiring a real client email tonight would have meant: building a Resend template for the completion notification, deciding on email-vs-link-vs-attachment delivery (PDF attachments raise spam-filter risk + privacy considerations), error handling/retry, plus testing on the public-token download path. Honest UX shipped tonight beats false UX with potential legal/trust risk; the real feature can ship later when there's time to do it right.
- **Approach (when picked up):**
  - New helper in `src/lib/onboarding-notifications.ts`: `sendOnboardingClientCompletionEmail({ clientEmail, clientFirstName, agentFullName, brokerageName, downloadLinks })`.
  - HTML template style matches the existing invite/reminder emails (brokerage header, blue CTA, "Powered by VettdRE" footer).
  - Body lists each signed document with a per-doc download link `https://app.vettdre.com/api/onboarding/{token}/download?docType={docType}` (links survive past expiry because completed onboardings stay 200-readable per slice 20-fixes-A's verify route fix).
  - Wire into `runPostCompletionWorkflow` in `src/app/api/onboarding/[token]/sign/route.ts` alongside the existing agent notification, fire-and-forget pattern.
  - Restore the "A copy has been emailed to you" line on `signing-complete.tsx` ONLY after the email send is verified working in prod (not before — the contract was that the line stays gone until the email is real).
- **Files:** `src/lib/onboarding-notifications.ts`, `src/app/api/onboarding/[token]/sign/route.ts`, `src/components/onboarding/signing-complete.tsx`, plus 1-2 smoke contracts (assert helper exists, assert sign-route invokes it on completion).
- **Estimated diff:** ~80-120 lines + 1-2 smoke contracts.
- **Stop conditions:** PDF attachment vs download-link decision — propose both, ask Nathan. Spam-filter testing — verify with a Gulino-domain test address before declaring done.
- **Depends on:** 20-fixes-A (merged); ideally also 20-fixes-B (P1 idempotency fix on the post-completion workflow — duplicate Contact race) so we don't email twice on a double-click.
- **Requires approval:** Yes if PDF attachment path chosen (new Resend feature scope); No if download-links-only.

### 19-fix-followup-doctype-enum — Custom templates use generic docType
- **Status:** `pending` (Phase 5 polish)
- **Goal:** Stop hardcoding `docType: "tenant_rep_agreement"` for ALL custom templates in `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/actions.ts:353`. Audit logs claim every custom template is a tenant rep agreement, which breaks any agent-side display or reporting that filters by docType.
- **Why deferred from slice 19-B1:** Real fix requires either (a) extending `OnboardingDocTypeValue` enum to allow string-based custom types or (b) adding a `customDocType` column on `OnboardingDocument`. Both are schema-touching work that requires migration planning. Slice 19-B1's iOS migration + visibility was urgent; this is technical-debt cleanup that doesn't affect production correctness today (routes query by `template.id`, not `docType`).
- **Approach (agent proposes details when slice begins):**
  - Option A: relax `OnboardingDocTypeValue` to `string` and let custom templates use slugified template names. Type system gets weaker but no migration.
  - Option B: add `customDocType: String?` on `OnboardingDocument` schema; populate when `templateId` references a `category: "custom"` template. Migration required.
- **Files:** `src/lib/onboarding-types.ts`, `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/actions.ts`, possibly `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **Stop conditions:** Schema migration if Option B chosen; surface and ask before applying.
- **Requires approval:** YES if Option B (schema change).

### 19-fix-followup-vault-rbac — Vault server actions don't enforce role
- **Status:** `pending` (Phase 5 polish)
- **Goal:** Add role-tier enforcement (`manage_templates` permission) to `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/vault-actions.ts` server actions. Today they check `getCurrentOrgContext()` for `orgId` only — agents who direct-URL `/vault` (bypassing the subnav RBAC gate that 19-B1 added) can upload, delete, and edit-fields on org templates.
- **Why deferred from slice 19-B1:** Pre-existing bug, not introduced by B1. B1's nav-level gate (manage_templates on PAGE_PERMISSION_MAP) closes the discovery vector for normal users, but the underlying server actions remain open. Hardening the actions is a bigger lift (auth helper integration, error-shape decisions for unauthorized access) that would have inflated B1's scope.
- **Approach:**
  - Each of `createDocumentTemplate`, `updateDocumentTemplate`, `deleteDocumentTemplate`, `updateTemplateFields` should call `getCurrentBrokerageRole()` and check `hasPermission(role, "manage_templates")` before any DB write. Return `{ success: false, error: "..." }` for unauthorized.
  - `getDocumentTemplates` is read-only — leave open since the /new picker reads it for all roles.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/vault-actions.ts`, plus 4-5 smoke contracts asserting role-gate enforcement.
- **Estimated diff:** ~40-60 lines.

### 19-fix-followup-ia-cleanup — Revisit vault URL location
- **Status:** `pending` (Phase 5 polish)
- **Goal:** Decide whether `/brokerage/client-onboarding/vault` should move to `/brokerage/settings/templates` (or `/settings/brokerage/templates`) once we know how Gulino's admins actually use it. Original SLICES.md spec suggested settings-tab placement; current implementation lives nested under client-onboarding.
- **Why deferred from slice 19-B1:** URL move is its own scoping conversation (settings-vs-onboarding nesting touches IA, deep-link bookmarks, redirect logic). Better to ship 19-B1 + 19-B2 first, observe usage, then decide.
- **Approach:** Look at telemetry/feedback from Gulino post-B2 ship. If admins report "I had to dig to find it," consider the move. Add a redirect from the old URL.
- **Files:** rename + redirect — TBD.
- **Stop conditions:** URL changes invalidate bookmarks; need redirect; touches sidebar + brokerage subnav + /new picker link.

### 19-fix-followup-doc-references — Document the existing vault in CLAUDE.md + SLICES.md
- **Status:** `pending` (Phase 5 polish)
- **Goal:** CLAUDE.md (under "Client Onboarding Tool" section) and SLICES.md (slice 19 audit history) currently don't reference the existing vault implementation that pre-dates the slice 19 audit. Fix the docs so future agents starting on slice 19-related work don't repeat the discovery process.
- **Why deferred from slice 19-B1:** Doc-cleanup pass is non-blocking and would inflate the B1 PR diff with prose changes that don't affect production behavior.
- **Files:** `CLAUDE.md`, `SLICES.md`.
- **Estimated diff:** ~30-50 lines, doc-only.

### 19-fix-followup-cross-page-move — Drag fields across page boundaries
- **Status:** `pending` (Phase 5 polish)
- **Goal:** Allow users to drag a field from page N to page N+1 by dragging it across a page boundary, instead of clamping at the boundary edge.
- **Why deferred from slice 19-B2a/B2b:** The editor renders one page at a time (B2a's design). For cross-page drag to work, the editor would need a multi-page-visible mode where pages are stacked vertically and the user can scroll/drag between them, OR a "snap to page N" gesture when the pointer reaches the boundary. Both are real product features that deserve their own scoping conversation. The Page selector in the field editor sidebar (defect 6 in B2a) gives users a manual recovery path that's enough for B2's scope: select field → change Page dropdown.
- **Approach (agent proposes details when slice begins):**
  - Option A: stacked-pages mode for "drag mode" only. Show all rendered pages in a vertical scroll; user can drag a field from page 1 down past the page-boundary line and drop on page 2. Click a field to select; right sidebar still shows per-field editor.
  - Option B: boundary-snap. When pointer crosses the page edge during a drag, switch the rendered page (auto-page-flip) and continue the drag on the new page.
  - Option C: drag-and-drop with explicit "Move to page" dialog when pointer exits canvas, similar to `confirm()`-based modal.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/vault/[id]/page.tsx`, possibly extract a `<MultiPagePdfEditor>` component if Option A.
- **Stop conditions:** Each option has UX trade-offs; surface and ask before implementing.
- **Requires approval:** YES — UX scope question.

### 19-fix-followup-keyboard-nudge — Arrow-key precision moves for selected fields
- **Status:** `pending` (Phase 5 polish)
- **Goal:** When a field is selected in the vault editor, arrow keys should nudge it by a small percentage step (e.g. 0.5%) for sub-pointer precision. Shift+arrow nudges by a larger step (e.g. 5%). Useful when admins are aligning a signature line to an exact baseline on a government form.
- **Why deferred from slice 19-B2b:** Pointer drag is the primary manipulation path; keyboard nudge is power-user polish. Adding keyboard handlers would inflate B2b past the 290-line budget and overlap with focus-management decisions (where does keyboard focus live? on the canvas? on the right-sidebar field row? on the field overlay itself?) that deserve their own scoping conversation.
- **Approach (agent proposes details when slice begins):**
  - Decide where keyboard focus lives — likely the field overlay itself with `tabIndex={0}`.
  - Add `onKeyDown` handler to the field overlay: ArrowUp/Down/Left/Right call `updateField` with x/y delta, clamped same as drag.
  - Shift+arrow uses larger step (5% vs 0.5%). Esc deselects.
  - Smoke contract anchors keyDown handler + delta math.
- **Files:** `src/app/(dashboard)/brokerage/client-onboarding/vault/[id]/page.tsx`, plus 2-3 smoke contracts.
- **Estimated diff:** ~40-60 lines.
- **Depends on:** 19-B2b (merged).
- **Requires approval:** Yes — focus management decision is a small UX call.

### deal-pipeline-delete — Remove dead-code deal-pipeline.tsx
- **Status:** `pending` (Phase 5 polish)
- **Goal:** Delete `src/app/(dashboard)/deals/deal-pipeline.tsx`. The file is dead code — exported as `DealPipeline` but `grep -rn "DealPipeline\b"` finds zero importers. The live deal pipeline UI is in `src/app/(dashboard)/deals/pipeline/page.tsx`; `deal-pipeline.tsx` is an older version that was superseded but never removed.
- **Why a separate slice:** discovered during slice 9-ext file-list audit. Migrating dead code's emoji would have been waste, so 9-ext skipped it. Deleting it here removes the temptation for future emoji/icon/typography sweeps to keep migrating it.
- **Verification before deletion:**
  - `grep -rn "DealPipeline\b" src/ tests/` returns only the file's own `export default function DealPipeline` (already confirmed during slice 9-ext audit, but re-verify just before deletion).
  - `grep -rn "deals/deal-pipeline\b" src/ tests/` returns zero — no path imports.
  - `npm run build` passes after deletion.
- **Files:** delete `src/app/(dashboard)/deals/deal-pipeline.tsx` (594 lines).
- **Estimated diff:** -594 lines, 1 file.
- **Smoke contracts:** none — deletion is its own contract (build + zero importers proof).
- **Depends on:** none.
- **Requires approval:** No.
